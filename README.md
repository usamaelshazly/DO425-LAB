When you create a pod, OpenShift runs the 'pod' process to create these namespaces and place the container processes in them. This means that all containers in a pod share the same network, the same System V IPC objects, and have the same host name.

**How to find PID in OpenShift?**

```bash
oc describe pod myweb-1-bmmwq | grep 'Container ID'                   # 7084...383d
runc state 7084...383d | grep "pid"                                   # 8997
nsenter -t 8997 -p -r ps -ef                                          # To use the ps command in a container namespace, also specify the -r or --root option to get the same file systems as the container. This is because the ps command uses the /proc file system to list the processes, and it needs to use the one from the container hierarchy and not the one from the host system.
```

**SECURING CONTAINERS WITH SELINUX**

- With OpenShift, containers processes always get the `container_t` context type when they start, and the files and directories the containers need to access on the host system gets the `container_file_t` context type.
- MCS (Multi Category Security) is a SELinux feature that solves issue of containers protect themselves from other container by taking advantage of the level part of the context: `system_u:system_r:container_t:s0:c4,c9` (s0=sensitives, c4,c9=categories). Sensitivity is not used, but categories are. Category values are between `c0` and `c1023` each. When a container starts, the system assigns two random categories to the processes in the container. But OpenShift behaves differently when assigning the SELinux categories - OpenShift allocates the two random categories at the project level. Therefore, and by default, all pods and containers in a project get the same category pair. This is useful when multiple containers in the project need to access the same shared volume.

**MANAGING RESOURCES WITH CGROUPS**

```bash
cat /proc/1938/cgroup                                                 # Systemd automatically organizes its services in control group hierarchies. It places all services under the /system.slice control groups
ls -l /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/system.slice/rsyslog.service/             # this is the standard structure
systemd-cgls                                                          # list all the control groups on the system
tree -d /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/kubepods.slice/                         # this is OpenShift/Kube specific structure
```

**LISTING AVAILABLE LINUX CAPABILITIES & LIMITING THEM**

```bash
capsh --print                                                         # capsh (Capabilities Shell) is a utility for viewing the available capabilities on a system for user running it
cat /proc/<PID>/status | grep Cap                                     # capabilities for process: CaCapInh (inheritable), CapPrm (permitted), CapEff (permission checks), CapBnd (bounding set), CapAmb (ambient)
capsh --decode=0000003fffffffff                                       # decode HEX
capsh --print -- -c "ping -c 1 localhost"                             # contains cap_net_raw among other things
capsh --drop=cap_net_raw --print -- -c "ping -c 1 localhost"          # drops the cap_net_raw capability which makes the ping fail
```

**MANAGING CAPABILITIES IN CONTAINERS**

- Podman possess a set of two options for managing capabilities: `--cap-add` and `--cap-drop`
- Default common capabilities by podman: `cap_chown`, `cap_mknod`, `cap_dac_override`, `cap_audit_write`, `cap_setfcap`, `cap_fsetid`

```bash
podman run --rm -it --name=capabilities rhel7/7.5 capsh --print
podman run --rm -it --cap-add=sys_time --name=test_caps rhel7/7.5 capsh --print # adds change system time capability
```

Avoid `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, which is too broad.

**INTRODUCING SECURE COMPUTING MODE `seccomp`**

- If a process attempts to perform a system call that it is not allowed to performed, the process is terminated according the policy that is in place
- Two modes:
  - A) allows a process to make only four system calls: `read()`, `write()`, `_exit()`, and `sigreturn()`. With this seccomp mode enabled, processes cannot fork new threads, nor monitor network activity.
  - B) seccomp-bpf Kernel extension allows generic system call filtering. For example, you can define a rule that allows a process to only access certain files. seccomp allows you to define a profile that contains a set of filters, which are applied to every system call that submitted from a process to the kernel.

**RESTRICTING PROCESSES WITH `seccomp`**

- To enable seccomp protection, a parent process sets a profile right before forking a child process
- Podman allows you to use the `--security-opt` option to attach a security profile to your container
- Two annotations:
  - A) `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod`
  - B) `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/<container_name>`

An example of the `custom_policy.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
  "architectures": [
    "SCMP_ARCH_X86_64",
    "SCMP_ARCH_X86",
    "SCMP_ARCH_X32"
  ],
  "syscalls": [
    {
      "names": [
        "chroot"
      ],
      "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
      "args": [],
      "comment": "",
      "includes": {
        "caps": [
          "CAP_SYS_CHROOT"
        ]
      },
      "excludes": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

Attach this policy to a container using Podman and test it:

```bash
sudo podman run --rm -it --security-opt seccomp=custom_policy.json --name chroot rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7 chroot / # not permitted
grep Seccomp /proc/10/status                                          # inspect the status file of any child process running inside the container
```

Another example:

```json
. . .
"syscalls": [
  { "name": "fchmodat",
    "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
    "args": []
  },
  { "name": "fchownat",
    "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
    "args": []
  }
]
```

Default seccomp profile

- Provides a sane default for running containers with seccomp and disables around 44 system calls out of 300+. It is moderately protective while providing wide application compatibility. The default Docker profile can be found:

`less /etc/docker/seccomp.json` - defaultAction is deny

```
# 3 actions:
SCMP_ACT_ALLOW
SCMP_ACT_KILL
SCMP_ACT_ERRNO
```

In effect, the profile is a whitelist which denies access to system calls by default, then whitelists specific system calls. The profile works by defining a `defaultAction` of `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` and overriding that action only for specific system calls. The effect of `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` is to cause a `Permission Denied` error. Next, the profile defines a specific list of system calls which are fully allowed, because their `action` is overridden to be `SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`. Finally, some specific rules are for individual system calls such as `personality`, and others, to allow variants of those system calls with specific arguments.

`strace -cf ping 172.25.250.13` shows table with used system calls

```bash
# It is not recommended to change the default seccomp profile, but rather --cap-add or --cap-drop:
podman run --name testsec -dit --security-opt=seccomp=seccomp.json --cap-drop NET_BIND_SERVICE hello-world
podman attach testsec
```

Limitations:

1. Filtering policies apply to the entire pod or container, and not only to the application running inside a container. Consider also the system calls that the container runtime makes when starting the container.
2. OpenShift does not support yet policy precedence. If developer defines custom profile for their containers, it overrides the default profile by OpenShift.

Identifying System Calls that Processes Invoke:

1. Creating a container with the `SYS_PTRACE` capability. This capability allows a container to trace arbitrary processes using ptrace
2. Invoking the strace command from inside the container.
3. Locating the commands that are invoked.
4. Updating the security policy to include all relevant system calls.
5. Instantiating a new container with the updated security profile.

## 2. Establishing Trusted Container Images

**Red Hat OpenShift Platform v3.11 points to the new `registry.redhat.io` registry by default**

```bash
podman login registry.redhat.io                                       # Podman stores your encrypted credentials in a file called /run/user/<UID>/containers/auth.json
skopeo inspect --creds developer1:MyS3cret! docker://registry.redhat.io/rhscl/postgresql-96-rhel7 # Skopeo uses the auth.json file from podman login, but you can alternatively do --creds (or --src-creds/--dest-creds for copy)
podman logout registry.redhat.io
podman logout --all
```

**QUAY**

```bash
podman login quay.apps.lab.example.com
podman pull quay.apps.lab.example.com/developer2/rhel-tools:latest    # or have the rhel-tools public and then you don't need auth
```

**Configuring Jenkins to support Quay integration**

To use Quay as the container image registry, some requirements must be addressed: The Quay repository must use a valid SSL certificate to communicate with OpenShift and Jenkins. If you are using self-signed certificates, each node from OpenShift must have the self-signed certificate in the Quay's certificate directory (`/etc/docker/certs.d/<quay-URI>`). Furthermore, the Jenkins slave container must have the certificate to sign the container image as well as the skopeo command line to push changes to the registry.

### LAB 2.1

```bash
lab containers-registries start
oc login -u admin -p redhat https://master.lab.example.com
oc project quay-enterprise                                            # groups all resources of Quay
oc get pods                                                           # Quay does not support running the database on OpenShift, but in the lab it does (you'll see clair, clair-postgresql, quay, quay-postgresql, redis)
oc get routes                                                         # e.g. https://quay.apps.lab.example.com
# Configure Quay here via web GUI (admin/redhat123) - create user, change password, create organisation
podman login quay.apps.lab.example.com                                # on the workstation
skopeo copy docker://registry.lab.example.com/httpd:latest docker://quay.apps.lab.example.com/exampledev/httpd:latest
podman logout quay.apps.lab.example.com
sudo -i
podman login quay.apps.lab.example.com                                # as developer1
podman pull quay.apps.lab.example.com/exampledev/httpd:latest
podman logout quay.apps.lab.example.com
lab containers-registries finish
```

**Using Images Annotations for Security**

```text
<namespace containing image's quality>/<vulnerability|policy>.<provider ID>
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.redhatcatalog: {SEE THE EXAMPLE BELOW}
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.jfrog: {SEE THE EXAMPLE BELOW}
quality.images.openshift.io/license.blackduck: {SEE THE EXAMPLE BELOW}
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.openscap: {SEE THE EXAMPLE BELOW}
```

Each annotation supports these fields:

- name (provider display name),
- timestamp of the scan,
- description (not required),
- reference,
- scannerVersion,
- compliant (yes x no),
- summary (label [critical/important], data, severityIndex, reference)

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Red Hat Container Catalog",
  "description": "Container health index",
  "timestamp": "2016-09-08T05:04:46Z",
  "reference": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2016:1566",
  "compliant": null,
  "scannerVersion": "1.2",
  "summary": [
    {
      "label": "Health index",
      "data": "B",
      "severityIndex": 1,
      "reference": null
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
oc describe is <image stream> -n openshift                            # read the status of an image stream to see the annotation
```

The annotation `images.openshift.io/deny-execution=true` is added by a security scanner, to define a policy that admission plugin prevents images from being retrieved if they are not marked as compliant: `vim /etc/origin/master/master-config.yml`:

```yaml
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    openshift.io/ImagePolicy:
      configuration:
        kind: ImagePolicyConfig
        apiVersion: v1
        resolveImages: AttemptRewrite
        executionRules:
        - name: execution-denied
          onResources:
          - resource: pods
          reject: true
          matchImageAnnotations:                                      # <-- important
          - key: images.openshift.io/deny-execution                   # <-- important
            value: "true"                                             # <-- important
          skipOnResolutionFailure: true
```

`master-restart api`
`master-restart controllers`

**Image signing and verification**

- Signer server is the host responsible for generating the signature that embeds the image manifest digest and publish the signature to the signatures server
- On the server, the `/etc/containers/registries.d/registry.yaml` location contains configuration files that specify where signatures are stored after their generation and where to download signature for each registry - e.g. `registry.yaml`:

```yaml
docker:
  registry.example.com:
    sigstore-staging: file:///var/lib/atomic/sigstore                 # stores new sigs under the filesystem
    sigstore: http://sigstore.lab.example.com                         # retrieves them from web
```

Configure clients (nodes pulling images) - you can have different policies for different nodes:

```bash
vim /etc/containers/policy.json                                       # images require signatures?
```

Allow only images from the registry.lab.example.com server. All other images are rejected:

```json
{
  "default": [
    {
      "type": "reject"
    }
  ],
  "transports": {
    "docker-daemon": {
      "": [
        {
          "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
        }
      ]
    },
    "docker": {
      "registry.lab.example.com": [
        {
          "type": "signedBy",
          "keyType": "GPGKeys",
          "keyPath": "/home/signer/pub/image-signer-pub.gpg"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Introducing Clair**

```bash
oc logs clair-2-bfp2c | grep fetching                                 # Clair log shows the retrieval of the vulnerability metadata from the Internet
```

- Clair only analyses images based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Alpine Linux, Debian, Oracle Linux, and Ubuntu because it only retrieves the vulnerabilities from these system vendors or projects
- Clair also limits its scan to the distribution packages and does NOT check vulnerabilities in your application code, or libraries or artifacts retrieved from other sources

## 3. Implementing Security in the Build Process

**Implementing Image Change Triggers**

```bash
oc set triggers bc build-config-name --from-image="image:tag"       # change made to that image stream automatically starts a build process, this configures image change trigger in an existing build config.

# The hook fails if the script or command returns a non-zero exit code or if starting the temporary container fails. In that case, the image is not pushed to the registry.
oc set build-hook bc/build-config-name --post-commit --command -- <command> # create build hook in an existing bc (or instead of --command, use --script="/path/to/script")
```

**Ensure Jenkins is deployed**

```bash
oc new-app jenkins --param ENABLE_OAUTH=true                          # deploy Jenkins container with persistent storage and use the OCP credentials to log in to it
```

To create Jenkins pipeline, you have to create this resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
//omitted
strategy:
  jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
    jenkinsfile: |-
    def mvnCmd = "mvn -s configuration/cicd-settings.xml"
    pipeline {
      agent {
        label 'maven'
      }
    //stages omitted
    }
  }
  type: JenkinsPipeline
```

```bash
oc create -f definition.yaml
oc start-build buildconfig-name
```

Integration point in a Jenkins Pipeline - slave hosts are started as containers using a Jenkins Kubernetes plugin:

- `<name>` is the name of the slave used in Jenkinsfile (agent - label)
- `<image>` is the container image to start the build process, there are many types of Jenkins slaves

Example of the agent definition:

```yaml
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  data:
    maven-template: |-
      <org.csanchez.jenkins.plugins.kubernetes.PodTemplate>
        <inheritFrom></inheritFrom>
        <name>maven</name>                                            # slave name used by Jenkins pipeline
        #configuration omitted
        <org.csanchez.jenkins.plugins.kubernetes.ContainerTemplate>
          <name>jnlp</name>
          <image>registry.lab.example.com/openshift/jenkins-agent-maven-35-centos7</image> # image used to start build process
  # configuration omitted
  </org.csanchez.jenkins.plugins.kubernetes.ContainerTemplate>
```

## 4. Managing User Access Control

RBAC resources:

- Users = can make requests to OpenShift API
- Service Accounts = used for delegating certain tasks to OpenShift
- Groups
- Roles = collections of rules
- Rules = define verbs that users/groups can use with a given resource
- Security Context Constraints = control the actions pod/container can perform
- Role bindings = roles to users/groups

```text
oc describe clusterrole admin
  Name: admin
  Created:  5 weeks ago
  Labels: kubernetes.io/bootstrapping=rbac-defaults
  Annotations:  openshift.io/description=A user that has edit rights within the project and can change the project's membership.
      openshift.io/reconcile-protect=false

  Verbs                     (...)     Resources
  [delete get patch update] (...)     [projects]                      # user can retrieve list of projects, delete/modify them
  [get list watch]          (...)     [namespaces]
```

Two levels:

1. Cluster-wide RBAC - applicable across all projects
2. Local RBAC - apply to a given project

```text
oc describe rolebinding admin -n developer                            # access local role bindings
  Name: admin
  Namespace:  developer
  Created:  9 minutes ago
  Labels: <none>
  Annotations:  <none>
  Role: /admin
  Users:  developer
  Groups: <none>
  ServiceAccounts:  <none>
  Subjects: <none>

  Verbs             (...) Resources
  [get list watch]  (...) [namespaces]
  [impersonate]     (...) [serviceaccounts]
  ...output omitted...
```

The following excerpt shows how to include a SCC to a role. This gives privileges to the user or the group that uses this role to access the `restricted-scc` security context constraint:

```yaml
rules:
  apiGroups:
  - security.openshift.io
  resources:
  - securitycontextconstraints                                        # name of the resource group that allows you to include a SCC in the role
  verbs:
  - use
  resourceNames:
  - restricted-scc                                                    # name of the SCC that is applied to all pods or containers that inherit this role
```

```bash
# Some of the defaults cluster roles that are available in OpenShift - e.g.:
oc describe clusterrole self-provisioner

# Groups & users
oc adm groups new <group_name> <user_name>
oc create user <user_name>

# Managing Roles
oc create role <name> --verb=<verb> --resource=<resource type> -n <project> # local role for a project
oc create clusterrole <name> --verb=<verb> --resource=<resource>      # cluster role

oc create role manager --verb=create,get,delete --resource=pod,service -n cicd
oc adm policy add-role-to-user manager developer -n cicd
```

A good list with all resources and verbs: `oc describe clusterrole.rbac`

Some examples of the role definition:

- This "Role" is allowed to read the resource "Pods" in the core API group:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: read-pods-within-ns
  namespace: default
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - pods
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
```

- This "Role" is allowed to read and write the "Deployments" in both the "extensions" and "apps" API groups:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: read-write-deployment-in-ext-and-apps-apis
  namespace: default
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - extensions
      - apps
    resources:
      - deployments
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
```

- This "Role" is allowed to read "Pods" and read/write "Jobs" resources in API groups:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: read-pods-and-read-write-jobs
  namespace: default
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - pods
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
  - apiGroups:
      - batch
      - extensions
    resources:
      - jobs
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
```

- This "Role" is allowed to read a "ConfigMap" named "my-config" (must be bound with a "RoleBinding" to limit to a single "ConfigMap" in a single namespace):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: read-configmap-within-ns
  namespace: default
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - configmaps
    resourceNames:
      - my-config
    verbs:
      - get
```

- This "ClusterRole" is allowed to read the resource "nodes" in the core group (because a Node is cluster-scoped, this must be bound with a "ClusterRoleBinding" to be effective):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: read-nodes
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - nodes
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
```

- This "ClusterRole" is allowed to "GET" and "POST" requests to the non-resource endpoint "/healthz" and all subpaths (must be in the "ClusterRole" bound with a "ClusterRoleBinding" to be effective):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: get-and-post-to-non-resource-endpoints
rules:
  - nonResourceURLs:
      - /healthz
      - /healthz/*
    verbs:
      - get
      - post
```

```bash

**CONFIGURING AN OPENSHIFT IDENTITY PROVIDER FOR RED HAT IDENTITY MANAGEMENT (IdM)**

- OpenShift masters can be configured with different identity providers that allow an OpenShift cluster to delegate user authentication and group membership management to different identity stores.
- To configure an OpenShift `LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider` identity provider to integrate with an IdM domain, you need the following information about your IdM domain and servers:
    - DNS domain name of your IdM domain (`organization.example.com`)
    - FQDN of one of your IdM servers (`ldap1.organization.example.com`)
    - LDAP user name with read access of the entire user accounts tree (`uid=admin,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com`)
    - LDAP container of the user accounts tree (`cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com`)
    - public key TLS certificate of your IdM domain (`/etc/ipa/ca.crt` file in any server or client of your IdM domain)
- Example stanza under the `identityProviders` attribute on the OpenShift master configuration file `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml`:

```yaml
. . .
identityProviders:
- challenge: true
  login: true
  mappingMethod: claim
  name: idm_ldap_auth                                                 # can be anything
  provider:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider
    attributes:
      id:
      - dn
      preferredUsername:
      - uid
    insecure: false                                                   # use TLS, refuse invalid certs
    ca: /etc/origin/master/idm-domain-ca.crt                          # public key TLS cert of the IdM domain
    url: "ldaps://server1.organization.example.net:636/cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com?uid" # LDAP search URL for user accounts
    bindDN: "uid=admin,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com" # username
    bindPassword: "secret"                                            # password
```

**SYNCHRONIZING GROUPS BETWEEN OPENSHIFT AND IdM**

```bash
oc adm groups sync --confirm                                          # run regularly to keep OpenShift and LDAP groups in sync
oc adm groups sync --help                                             # whitelist & blacklist!
    # Sync all groups from an LDAP server
    oc adm groups sync --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm # see LDAPSyncConfig

    # Sync all groups except the ones from the blacklist file from an LDAP server
    oc adm groups sync --blacklist=/path/to/blacklist.txt --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm

    # Sync specific groups specified in a whitelist file with an LDAP server
    oc adm groups sync --whitelist=/path/to/whitelist.txt --sync-config=/path/to/sync-config.yaml --confirm

    # Sync all OpenShift Groups that have been synced previously with an LDAP server
    oc adm groups sync --type=openshift --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm

    # Sync specific OpenShift Groups if they have been synced previously with an LDAP server
    oc adm groups sync groups/group1 groups/group2 groups/group3 --sync-config=/path/to/sync-config.yaml --confirm

  Options:
    --blacklist='': path to the group blacklist file
    --confirm=false: if true, modify OpenShift groups; if false, display results of a dry-run
    --sync-config='': path to the sync config
    --type='ldap': which groups white- and blacklist entries refer to: ldap,openshift
    --whitelist='': path to the group whitelist file

oc adm groups prune --confirm                                         # deletes all current orphan groups from OpenShift
```

**Configuring LDAP Synchronization Connection Parameters (similar to LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider):**

```yaml
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
url: ldaps://server1.organization.example.com:636                     # LDAP URI FQDN
bindDN: uid=admin,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com # username
bindPassword: secret                                                  # plaintext password
insecure: false                                                       # not allowing insecure communication and thus forcing TLS
ca: /home/student/idm-ca.crt                                          # must exist on the client where you run the 'oc'
augmentedActiveDirectory:                                             # variation of MS AD schema
  groupsQuery:
    baseDN: "cn=groups,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com" # user account container
    scope: sub
    derefAliases: never
    pageSize: 0
  groupUIDAttribute: dn
  groupNameAttributes: [ cn ]
  usersQuery:
    baseDN: "cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com"  # groups container
    scope: sub
    derefAliases: never
    filter: (objectclass=inetOrgPerson)
    pageSize: 0
userNameAttributes: [ uid ]
groupMembershipAttributes: [ memberOf ]
```

**MANAGING OPENSHIFT USERS AND IDENTITIES**

- You may need to delete the identity resource for a user if the same user name exists on different identity providers.

```bash
oc get user
  NAME    ...   IDENTITIES
  admin   ...   htpasswd_auth:admin
  idmuser ...   idm_ldap_auth:uid=idmuser,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=...
```

OpenShift retains identities for deleted users, and these identities may prevent a new user from logging in, if that user has the same name of an old user:

```bash
oc delete user idmuser
oc delete identity idm_ldap_auth:uid=idmuser,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=...
```

**DEPLOYING SINGLE SIGN-ON ON OPENSHIFT**

Passthrough vs. re-encryption SSO templates

Typically coming from `registry.redhat.io/redhat-sso-7/sso72-openshift:1.0` (or v1.1, v1.2 ...)

To integrate an application with Red Hat's SSO server you define and configure, at minimum, one 'realm', one or more 'clients', and one or more 'users':

1. Web console: `https://sso-fqdn/auth/admin`
2. `/bin/kadm.sh`

**CONFIGURING AN OPENSHIFT IDENTITY PROVIDER FOR SSO**

The `OpenIDIdentityProvider` identity provider allows OpenShift to delegate authentication to a SSO server using the OpenID Connect standard (`master-config.yml`):

```yaml
. . .
identityProviders:
- challenge: true
  login: true
  mappingMethod: claim
  name: sso_realm                                                     # name of your choice
  provider:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: OpenIDIdentityProvider
    clientID: MyApp                                                   # client ID of existing client on the SSO realm
    clientSecret: 41b5677d-09b1-4ffc-890a-99f10204bde9                # secret of the SSO client
    ca: /etc/origin/master/ca-bundle.crt                              # absolute path on the master
    urls:
      authorize: https://sso.server.example.com/auth/realms/MyRealm/protocol/openid-connect/auth
      token: https://sso.server.lab.example.com/auth/realms/MyRealm/protocol/openid-connect/token
      userInfo: https://sso.server.lab.example.com/auth/realms/MyRealm/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
    claims:
      id:
      - sub
      preferredUsername:
      - preferred_username
      name:
      - name
      email:
      - email
```

The OpenID Connect API endpoints of your SSO realm, that follow the format: `https://<sso-server-fqdn>/auth/realms/<RealmName>/protocol/openid-connect/<operation>`

operation = Name of an OpenID Connect API operation, such as 'auth', 'token', and 'userinfo'

```bash
curl -sk https://sso-server-fqdn/auth/realms/RealmName /.well-known/openid-configuration | python -m json.tool # lists all URLs for a SSO realm, for example the RealmName realm
```

## 5. Controlling the Deployment Environment

**REVIEWING SECRETS AND CONFIGMAPS**

- You can store the registry credentials in a secret and instruct OpenShift to use that secret when it needs to push and pull images from the registry.

**SECRETS**

Individual secrets are limited to 1MB in size.

```bash
oc create secret generic secret_name --from-literal=username=operator --from-literal=password=MyS3cr3T
```

Or in YAML:

```bash
echo operator | base64                                                # b3BlcmF0b3IK
echo MyS3cr3T | base64                                                # TXlTM2NyM1QK
vim secret.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret_name
data:
  username: b3BlcmF0b3IK                                              # must be base64 encoded
  password: TXlTM2NyM1QK                                              # must be base64 encoded
```

```bash
oc create -f secret.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: test-secret
  namespace: my-namespace
type: Opaque                                                          # bypasses any validation
data:
  password: dmFsdWUtMQ0K                                              # must be base64 encoded
stringData:
  hostname: myapp.mydomain.com
  admin_password: redhat123                                           # plain text value will automatically be converted to base64
```

How to use the above secret in the deployment config:

```yaml
...output omitted...
env:
- name: APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD                                            # environment variable retrieves value from test-secret secret
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:                                                     # similarly to configMapKeyRef
      name: test-secret
      key: admin_password
```

Another use case is the passing of data, such as TLS certificates, to an application by using the `--from-file=file` option. This exposes a sensitive file to an application. The pod definition can reference the secret, which creates the secret as files in a volume mounted on one or more of the application containers.

```yaml
...output omitted...
      spec:
        containers:
...output omitted...
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /conf/app/extra_ca_certs                       # mounts certs_volume to /conf/app/extra_ca_certs
            name: certs_volume
        volumes:
        - name: certs_volume
          secret:
            defaultMode: 420
            secretName: application-certificates                      # maps the volume to application_certificates secret
```

**CONFIGURATION MAP**

```bash
oc create configmap special-config --from-literal=serverAddress=172.20.30.40
```

Or in YAML:

```bash
vim special-config.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: special-config
data:
  serverAddress: 172.20.30.40
```

```bash
oc create -f special-config.yaml
```

Populate the APISERVER environment variable inside a pod definition from the above configuration map:

```yaml
env:
- name: APISERVER
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:                                                  # similarly to secretKeyRef
      name: special-config
      key: serverAddress
```

**Encrypting Secrets in Etcd**

1. On master nodes, define the experimental-encryption-provider-config in the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
...output omitted...
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    experimental-encryption-provider-config:                          # <-- important
    - /etc/origin/master/encryption-config.yaml                       # <-- important
    storage-backend:
    - etcd3
...output omitted...
```

2. Create `encryption-config.yaml` file: `vim /etc/origin/master/encryption-config.yaml`

```yaml
kind: EncryptionConfig
apiVersion: v1
resources:
  - resources:
    - secrets:
    providers:
    - aescbc:                                                         # algorithm used, strongest cypher
      keys:
      - name: key1
        secret: hifzYhVwbOFYL7X+oGoEqwblf94sJFoVg7IOECcCk+Q=          # base64 encoded and 32-byte length
    - identity: {}
```

```bash
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64                                      # random secret used above as key1
master-restart api
master-restart controllers
# From now on, new secret object are encrypted:
etcdctl3 get /kubernetes.io/secrets/mytest/mysecret2 -w fields --cacert=/etc/etcd/ca.crt --key=/etc/etcd/peer.key --cert=/etc/etcd/peer.crt --endpoints 'https://172.25.250.10:2379' | grep Value
# If you need to encrypt already existing secrets:
oc adm migrate storage --include=secrets --confirm                    # reads all secrets then updates them to apply server-side encryption
```

**Preparing Secrets for Accessing Authenticated Registry**

```bash
oc create secret docker-registry <secret_name> --docker-username=<user> --docker-password=<pass> --docker-server=<registry_full_host_name>
```

With Quay, you can create robot accounts (tokens) and grant them access to the repositories in an organization. Quay can generate a YAML Kubernetes resource file that you can also use with OpenShift (`oc create -f ~/Downloads/myorg-openshift-secret.yml`).

**Configuring Project Service Account for Image PUSHING**

The build process uses the OpenShift builder service account in your project. For the builder service account to automatically use that secret for authentication, link it to the secret:

```bash
oc secrets link serviceaccount/builder secret/<secret_name>
oc new-build GIT_project_URL --push-secret=<secret_name> --to-docker --to=<remote_registry>/<namespace>/<image> # S2I build process will now push to another registry
```

**Configuring Project Service Account for Image PULLING**

```bash
oc secrets link serviceaccount/default secret/<secret_name> --for=pull # link default SA in your project to the secret
```

**Configuring OpenShift for Accepting Certificates Signed by a Private CA**

1. Install CA's certificate on each node, under the `/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry_full_host_name>/` directory:

```bash
mkdir /etc/docker/certs.d/quay.apps.lab.example.com/
mv -v ca.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/quay.apps.lab.example.com/
```

2. And on the master you need to do:

```bash
# v3.10 and later:
# Configure the OpenShift API Server to use the CA's certificate, on the master you do:
cat myca.crt >> /etc/origin/master/ca-bundle.crt
# Path to the /etc/origin/master/ca-bundle.crt file is defined by the 'additionalTrustedCA' variable in /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml. So if there is a reference to 'additionalTrustedCA' in the 'imageImportPolicy' section of the master config, you need to do for example:
cat myca.crt >> /etc/origin/master/additional_ca.crt
master-restart api
```

Or:

```bash
# v3.11.43 and later:
oc version                                                            # v3.11?
# in addition to the certificates in /etc/origin/master/ca-bundle.crt, the API server also trusts the certificates in the system /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt file, to automatically append:
mv -v ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
update-ca-trust extract                                               # this will append the CA to the file
```

**LIMITING REGISTRIES, PROJECTS, AND IMAGES**

```bash
cat /etc/containers/policy.json                                       # on all nodes, no need to restart when changed, default file accepts any image:
```

```json
{
  "default": [
    {
      "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
    }
  ],
  "transports":
    {
      "docker-daemon":
      {
        "": [{"type":"insecureAcceptAnything"}]
      }
    }
}
```

- system uses the default entry when no other rule matches
- `insecureAcceptAnything` = accept any image
- `reject` = refuse all images (usually set this requirement in the default entry and add specific rules to allow your images)
- `signedBy` = accept signed images (provide additional parameters such as the public GPG key to use to verify signatures)
- Using wildcards or partial names does NOT work!
- Under the `transports` section file groups registries by type: `docker` (Registry v2 API), `atomic` (OCR), `docker-daemon` (local daemon storage):

Another example:

```json
{
    "default": [
        {
            "type": "reject"                                          <-- reject all images if no other rule matches
        }
    ],
    "transports": {
        "docker": {
            "registry.access.redhat.com": [                           <-- use any images from registr.access.redhat.com as long as they are GPG signed
                {
                    "type": "signedBy",
                    "keyType": "GPGKeys",
                    "keyPath": "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release"
                }
            ],
            "quay.apps.lab.example.com/production": [                 <-- use any image from the production organization in Quay
                {
                    "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
                }
            ],
            "quay.apps.lab.example.com/staging/mypostgres-95:latest": [ <-- pull latest tag of the mypostgresl image in the staging of Quay
                {
                    "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
                }
            ]
        },
        "atomic": {
            "172.30.13.172:5000": [                                   <-- pull any image from the local OpenShift Container Registry (OCR)
                {
                    "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
                }
            ]
        },
        "docker-daemon": {
            "": [
                {
                    "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

**Configuring Signature Transports**

That above configuration (`"type"`, `"keyType"`, `"keyPath"`) is not enough; you also need to indicate the URL to the web server that stores the detached image signatures. To declare that URL, create a file under `/etc/containers/registries.d/` such as:

```bash
cat /etc/containers/registries.d/redhat.yaml
docker:
  registry.access.redhat.com:
    sigstore: https://access.redhat.com/webassets/docker/content/sigstore
```

For the OpenShift Container Registry, that you define with the 'atomic' transport type, you do not need to perform this extra configuration. The OCR has API extensions to store the signatures, and the atomic transport type consumes them.

**USING DEPLOYMENT TRIGGERS**

```bash
oc get dc                                                             # look at 'TRIGGERED BY' column
```

For example if it says `config,image(redis:latest)`, there are two types of triggers:

1. A configuration change trigger causes a new deployment to be created any time you update the deployment configuration object itself.
2. An image change trigger causes OpenShift to redeploy the application each time a new version of the redis:latest image is available in the registry

When you create an application with the `oc new-app` command, or from the web interface, OpenShift creates a deployment configuration object with the above two triggers already defined.

This is how it looks like in the YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.openshift.io/v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
...output omitted...
  triggers:
  - type: ConfigChange
  - type: ImageChange
    imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true
      containerNames:
      - <container_name>
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: <image_stream_name>:latest
        namespace: <image_stream_project>
  template:
...output omitted...
```

```bash
# Use the oc set triggers command on an existing deployment configuration object:
oc set triggers dc/<dc_name> --from-image=<image_stream_project>/<image_stream_name>:latest -c <container_name>
# Use the oc import-image command to create an image stream object from an image in a remote repository (and poll regularly):
oc import-image <image_stream_name> --from=<registry_full_host_name>/<namespace>/<image_name> --confirm --scheduled=true
# Follow the triggering of new deployments (similar to 'Events' column in oc describe dc <dc_name>):
oc rollout history dc/<dc_name>
```

**CUSTOMIZING OPENSHIFT PIPELINES**

1. Clone a Git repository and execute a Maven build and installation:

  ```text
  stage('Build App') {
    steps {
      git url: 'http://services.lab.example.com/bookstore'
      sh "mvn install -DskipTests=true"
    }
  }
  ```

2. Submit the code for analysis to a SonarQube instance:

  ```text
  stage('Code Analysis') {
    steps {
      script {
        sh "mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.host.url=http://sonarqube:9000 -DskipTests=true"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

3. Input command asks the user for confirmation:

  ```text
  stage('Promote to QA?') {
    steps {
      timeout(time:15, unit:'MINUTES') {
        input message: "Promote to QA?", ok: "Promote"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

4. Pipeline can also make calls to OpenShift - this rolls out the deployment of the application latest image in the `bookstore-qa` project:

  ```text
  stage('Deploy QA') {
    steps {
      script {
        openshift.withCluster() {
          openshift.withProject('bookstore-qa') {
            openshift.selector('dc', 'bookstore').rollout().latest()
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### LAB 5.1

# Use the Red Hat Quay Enterprise web interface to create the operator2 user account and set its password to redhat123. Also create the deploymentpolicy organization and a robot account named openshift with read access to the organization's repositories.

podman login quay.apps.lab.example.com                                # operator2/redhat123

**SECURITY CONTEXT CONSTRAINTS (SCCs)**

- SCCs define conditions that a pod must satisfy in order to be created
- Similar to policies, which enforce certain actions or prevent others from a service or a user (or service account)
- By default resources get `restricted` SCC (no root, mknod, setuid)
- Create your own SCC rather than modifying a predefined SCC

Control:

1. Privileged mode - running privileged containers should be avoided at all costs
2. Privileges escalation - on/off privileges escalation inside a container
3. Linux capabilities - Linux capabilities to and from your containers (e.g. KILL)
4. Seccomp profiles - allow or block certain system calls (e.g. CAP_CHOWN)
5. Volume types - permit or prevent certain volume types (e.g. emptyDir)
6. System control (Sysctl) settings - modify kernel parameters at runtime
7. Host resources - permit or prevent a pod for accessing the following host resources: IPC namespaces, host networks, host ports, and host PID namespaces
8. Read-only root file system - forces users to mount a volume if they need to store data
9. User and group IDs - restricting users to a certain set of ID or GIDs. Each project gets assigned its own range, as defined by a project annotation, such as `openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range=1000190000/10000` and `openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups=1000190000/10000`. `/`=number of allowed values (e.g. 1000190000 up to 1000200000).
10. SELinux labels - define an SELinux label to the pods
11. File system groups - allows you to define supplemental groups for the user, which is usually required for accessing a block device

**Introducing SCC Strategies**

Categories:

1. Boolean (`Allow Privileged: true`)
2. Allowable set (`RequiredDropCapabilites: KILL,MKNOD,SETUID,SETGID`)
3. Controlled by a strategy, SCC Strategies:
    1. `RunAsAny` - any ID defined in the pod definition (or image) is allowed (security issue), no SELinux labels
    2. `MustRunAsRange` - the project or the pod must provide a range within an allowable set, lowest value is default
        - Run As User Strategy:

          ```text
          MustRunAsRange
          UID: <none>
          UID Range Min: 10000000
          UID Range Max:10000100
          ```

    3. `MustRunAs` - project or the pod must provide a single value, for example SELinux context

**Managing Supplemental Groups - shared storage example (e.g. NFS)**

```bash
# You should not be running containers as root, only containers with an UID of 100001 or members of the group with the ID of 100099 are permitted to access the NFS storage:
oc describe demo-project
  ...output omitted...
  Annotations: openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups=1000190000/10000 # default range in OpenShift
  ...output omitted...
ls -lZ /opt/app/nfs -d                                                # NFS server defines a directory accessible by the user ID 100001 and the group ID 100099
```

Annotation is used by OpenShift to determine the range for supplemental groups.

I. One way to allow access to the NFS share is to be explicit in the pod definition by defining a supplemental groups that all containers inherit. All containers that are created in the project are then members of the group 100099, which grants access to the volume, regardless of the container's user ID:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
...output omitted...
spec:
  containers:
  - name: application
  securityContext:
    supplementalGroups: [ 100099 ]                                    # arra of supplemental group(s)
...output omitted...
```

```bash
oc rsh application-pod id
  uid=1000190000 gid=0(root) groups=0(root),100099,1000190000
# You must also ensure that the value is within the allowable range. This is enforced if the strategy for supplemental groups is set to MustRunAsRange. You must then ensure that the SCC applied to the pod allows this value.
```

II. Another solution is the creation of a custom SCC that defines a range for the group IDs, enforces the usage of a value inside the range, allows the GID 100099:

```yaml
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
...output omitted...
priority: 10                                                          # larger number = higher priority
supplementalGroups:
  type: MustRunAs                                                     # strategy
  ranges:                                                             # allowed range
  - min: 100050
    max: 100100
...output omitted...
```

**Managing File System Groups - block storage example (e.g. iSCSI)**

Unlike shared storage, block storage is taken over by a pod, which means that the user and group IDs supplied in the pod definition are applied to the physical block device. If the pod uses a restricted SCC that defines a `fsGroup` with a strategy of `MustRunAs`, then the pod will fail to run. OpenShift doesn't allocate any GID to block storage, so if the pod definition doesn't explicitly set `fsGroup` and SCC uses RunAsAny, permission may still be denied! Define a file system group in the pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
...output omitted...
spec:
  containers:
  - name: application
  securityContext:
    fsGroup: [ 600 ]                                                  # filesystem group applied to the block storage
...output omitted...
```

**Managing SELinux context with SCCs**

Restricted SCC defines a strategy of `MustRunAs`, the project must define the options, such as user, role, type, and level otherwise pod will not be created

At creation time, OpenShift assigns a SELinux type to containers' main process, `container_runtime_t`

Define the values for the SELinux context in SCC and relationship with the project:

```text
oc describe scc restricted
  ...output omitted..
  SELinux Context Strategy: MustRunAs
    User: <none>
    Role: <none>
    Type: <none>
    Level: <none>
oc describe project default
  ...output omitted...
  Annotations: openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs=s0:c1,c0
```

If the pod needs to access a volume, the same categories must be defined for the volume. Define the SELinux context for a pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  ...output omitted...
  securityContext:
    seLinuxOptions:
      level: "s0:c123,c456"                                           # sensitivity 0, categories 123,456 = same must be on the volume
```

**MANAGING SCCS**

Custom SCC (only cluster admin can create it):

```yaml
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: custom-scc
allowHostNetwork: True                                                <-- access to the host namespaces and network stack

requiredDropCapabilities:                                             <-- two Linux capabilities to drop
- KILL

runAsUser:
  type: RunAsAny                                                      <-- mandatory strategy for the user
seLinuxContext:
  type: RunAsAny                                                      <-- mandatory SELinux context
```

```bash
oc create -f custom-scc.yaml
oc describe scc custom-scc
# In order to use a custom seccomp profile, you need to enable the seccomp-profile-root directive in the kubeletArguments section of the nodes' configuration file /etc/origin/node/node-config.yml to point to a directory that contains seccomp profiles. The file must be present on all nodes + systemctl restart origin-node:
# kubeletArguments:
#   seccomp-profile-root:
#     - "/path/to/profile"
oc delete scc custom-scc
```

**Managing Service Accounts for SCCs**

Service accounts can be member of an SCC, similarly to users. This restricts all resources created by a service account to inherit the restrictions of the SCC. By default, pods run with the default service account, unless you specify a different service account. All authenticated users are automatically added to the system:authenticated group. As such, all authenticated users inherit the restricted SCC:

```bash
oc describe scc restricted | grep 'Groups:'                           # system:authenticated
```

If a container requires elevated privileges or special privileges, create a new service account and make it member of an existing SCC, or create your own SCC and make the service account member of that SCC. Every service account has an associated user name, so it can be added to any specific SCC.

Creating a custom service account and make it member of the anyuid SCC, which allows pods to use any UID:

```bash
oc create serviceaccount app-sa
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z app-sa                        # -z=service account in the current project
# If you need to add a SCC to the service account from another project (demo-project):
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:demo-project:app-sa
# Update an existing deployment configuration or pod definition:
  ...output omitted...
  spec:
    containers:
      - image: registry-demo.lab.example.com/my-app:latest
        name: my-app
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: app-sa                                      # <--
```

## 6. Managing Secure Platform Orchestration

**MANAGING APPLICATION HEALTH**

1. Liveness Probe - is the pod healthy?
2. Readiness Probe - is the pod ready to serve requests?

**MANAGING APPLICATION SCHEDULING**

Scheduler filters the list of running nodes by the availability of node resources, such as host ports or memory

A common use for affinity rules is to schedule related pods to be close to each other for performance reasons.

A common use case for anti-affinity rules is to schedule related pods not too close to each other for high availability reasons.

Rules can be: mandatory (required) or best-effort (preferred)

Define 8 nodes, two regions, us-west and us-east, and a set of two zones in each region:

```bash
oc label node node1 region=us-west zone=power1a                       # west
oc label node node2 region=us-west zone=power1a
oc label node node3 region=us-west zone=power2a
oc label node node4 region=us-west zone=power2a
oc label node node5 region=us-east zone=power1b                       # east
oc label node node6 region=us-east zone=power1b
oc label node node7 region=us-east zone=power2b
oc label node node8 region=us-east zone=power2b
oc get nodes -L zone -L region                                        # inspect the labels assigned to nodes
```

Rule that requires the pod be placed on a node with a label whose key is `compute-CA-NorthSouth` and whose value is either `compute-CA-North` or `compute-CA-South`:

`oc label node9 compute-CA-NorthSouth=compute-CA-North`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: with-node-affinity
spec:
  affinity:                                                           # different from nodeSelector
    nodeAffinity:                                                     # defines usage of affinity
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:                 # it requires rule to enforce placement. 'required' can also be 'preferred', but then you also need 'weight' value
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:                                           # must match this
          - key: compute-CA-NorthSouth
            operator: In                                              # In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist, Lt, Gt
            values:
            - compute-CA-North                                        # first value that must match
            - compute-CA-South                                        # second value that must match to apply the rule
  containers:
  - name: with-node-affinity
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7
```

Node selector can be part of pod definition or deployment config (the below triggers new deployment):

```bash
oc patch dc dev-app --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"nodeSelector":{"env":"dev"}}}}' # configure the dev-app deployment configuration so that its pods only run on nodes that have the env=dev label
```

Same in YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:                                                       # different from affinity
    env: dev
  containers:
    - image: registry.lab.example.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7:latest

oc adm manage-node --schedulable=false <node>                         # mark a node as unschedulable
oc adm drain <node> --delete-local-data --ignore-daemonsets           # destroys (evicts) all pods running on the node and instructs OpenShift to recreate the pods, --delete-local-data is for emptyDir pods
```

**MANAGING RESOURCE USAGE**

Define limits in a deployment configuration instead of a pod definition

1. Resource requests - indicate that a pod cannot run with less than the specified amount of resources (essentially requirements)
2. Resource limits - prevent a pod from using up all compute resources from a node

**Managing Quotas**

`ResourceQuota` resource object specifies hard resource usage limits for a project; all attributes of a quota are optional, meaning that any resource that is not restricted by a quota can be consumed without bounds (you can restrict e.g. pods, rc, svc, secrets, pvcs, CPU, memory, storage).

`ClusterResourceQuota` resource is created at the cluster level, uses `openshift.io/requester` annotation:

```bash
oc create clusterquota user-prod --project-annotation-selector openshift.io/requester=production --hard pods=12 --hard secrets=20 # create a cluster quota for all projects owned by the production user
oc create clusterquota env-qa --project-label-selector environment=qa --hard pods=10 --hard services=5 # create a cluster quota for all the projects with a label of environment=qa
oc delete clusterquota <quota>
```

ResourceQuota resource object that defines limits for CPU and memory:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: my-quota
spec:
  hard:
    limits.memory: "400Mi"                                            # by default quota attributes track resource request
    limits.cpu: "1200m"                                               # ...prefix the attribute with 'limits.' to track resource limits
```

```bash
oc describe quota
  Name: my-quota
  Namespace:  dev-env                                                 # If a quota that restricts the use of compute resources for a project is set, OpenShift refuses to create pods that do not specify resource requests or resource limits
  Resource      Used  Hard
  --------      ----  ----
  limits.cpu    400m  1200m                                           # millicores
  limits.memory 128Mi 400Mi                                           # mebibytes (1MiB=1,048,576b)
```

**Managing Limit Ranges**

`LimitRange` resource, also called a limit, defines the default, minimum, and maximum values for compute resource requests and limits (also storage - default, min, max capacity requested by image, is, pvc) for a single pod or for a single container defined inside the project. A resource request or limit for a pod is the sum of its containers.

To understand the difference between a limit range and a resource quota resource, consider that a limit range defines valid ranges and default values for a single pod, while a resource quota defines only maximum values for the sum of all pods in a project.

The following listing shows a limit range defined using YAML syntax:

```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "LimitRange"
metadata:
  name: "limit-range"
spec:
  limits:
    - type: "Pod"
      max:
        cpu: "400m"                                                   # maximum CPU allowed across all containers in a pod
        memory: "256Mi"
      min:
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "64Mi"
    - type: "Container"
      max:
        cpu: "400m"                                                   # maximum CPU allowed per container
        memory: "256Mi"                                               # maximum memory allowed per container
      min:
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "64Mi"
      default:
        cpu: "200m"
        memory: "64Mi"
      defaultRequest:
        cpu: "200m"
        memory: "64Mi"
    - type: "PersistentVolumeClaim"
      min:
        storage: 2Gi
      max:
        storage: 50Gi                                                 # maximum capacity of the volume that can be requested by one claim
    - type: openshift.io/Image                                        # maximum size of an image that can be pushed to OCR
      max:
        storage: 1Gi
```

```bash
oc create -f limits.yml
oc get limits
  Name:       limit-range
  Namespace:  dev-project
  Type        Resource  Min   Max    Default Request  Default Limit
  ----        --------  ---   ---    ---------------  -------------
  Pod         cpu       100m  400m   -                -
  Pod         memory    64Mi  256Mi  -                -
  Container   cpu       100m  400m   200m             200m
  Container   memory    64Mi  256Mi  64Mi             64Mi
```

After creating a limit range in a project, all resource create requests are evaluated against each limit range resource in the project. If the new resource violates the minimum or maximum constraint enumerated by any limit, OpenShift rejects the resource. If the new resource does not set an explicit value, and the constraint supports a default value, then the default value is applied to the new resource as its usage value.

**OPENSHIFT SECURITY MODEL**

Infrastructure components, such as application nodes, use client certificates that OpenShift generates. Infrastructure components that run in containers use a token associated with their service account to connect to the API.

OpenShift Container Platform creates the PKI and generates the certificates at installation time. OpenShift uses an internal CA (`openshift-signer`) to generate and sign all the certificates that are listed in the master-config.yaml configuration file. This can be overriden in Ansible:

```text
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/to/certificate.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/private-key.key", "cafile": "/path/to/ca.crt"}]
```

To override names:

```text
openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates=true
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/to/certificate.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/private-key.key", "names": ["public-master-host.com"], "cafile": "/path/to/ca.crt"}]
```

On the master server, there are ~20 certificates and keys that are generated at installation time:

```bash
ls -l /etc/origin/master/*.{crt,key}
  additional_ca.crt                                                   # + .key
  ca-bundle.crt                                                       # + .key
  etcd.server.crt                                                     # + .key
  master.kubelet-client.crt                                           # + .key
  registry.crt                                                        # + .key

## 7. Providing Secure Network I/O

**ISTIO**

Sidecars sit alongside microservices and route requests to other proxies. These components form a mesh network.

- Definition of a `VirtualService`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - production.prod.svc.cluster.local
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: production-v2.prod.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v2
      weight: 25
    - destination:
        host: production-v1.prod.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v1
      weight: 75
```

- The `DestinationRule` associated with this virtual service:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: production-destination
spec:
  host: production.prod.svc.cluster.local
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
```

**MANAGING SECURE TRAFFIC IN OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM**

OpenShift can manage certificates by generating an X.509 certificate and a key pair as a secret in your application name spaces. Certificates are valid for the internal DNS name `service_name.namespace.svc`.

The following Red Hat Single Sign-on template shows how the service resource defines the annotation `service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` for generating the certificate with a value of `sso-x509-https-secret`.

The pod mounts the volume that contains this certificate in `/etc/x509/https`, as referenced by `secretName: sso-x509-https-secret` in the volumes section:

```yaml
kind: Template
apiVersion: v1
...output omitted...
objects:
- kind: Service                                                       # <--
  spec:
  metadata:
    annotations:
      service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: sso-x509-https-secret # <--
- kind: DeploymentConfig                                              # <--
...output omitted...
  spec:
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: "${APPLICATION_NAME}"
          image: "${APPLICATION_NAME}"
...output omitted...
          volumeMounts:
          - name: sso-x509-https-volume
            mountPath: "/etc/x509/https"
            readOnly: true
          volumes:
          - name: sso-x509-https-volume
            secret:
              secretName: sso-x509-https-secret                       # <--
```

Service serving certificates allow a pod to mount the secret and use them accordingly. The certificate and key are in PEM format, and stored as `tls.crt` and `tls.key`.

OpenShift automatically replaces the certificate when it gets close to expiration.

Pods can use these security certificates by reading the CA bundle located at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt`, which is automatically exposed inside pods.

If the service certificate generation fails, force certificate regeneration by removing the old secret, and clearing the following two annotations on the service:

```text
service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-<error_number>
service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num-<error_number>
```

The service serving certificates are generated on-demand, and thus are different from those used by OpenShift for node-to-node or node-to-master communication.

**Managing Network Policies in OpenShift**

3 SDNs:

1. `ovs-subnet` - flat network that spreads across all the cluster nodes and connects all the pods
2. `ovs-multitenant` - isolates each OpenShift project. By default, the pods in a project cannot access pods in other projects. The following command allows projectA to access pods and services in projectB, and vice versa: `oc adm pod-network join-projects --to=projectA projectB` - this give access to all pods & services in project.
`oc adm pod-network isolate-projects <project1> <project2>` - nothing can access between the projects
3. `ovs-networkpolicy` - To use network policies, you need to switch from the default SDN provider to the `redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy` provider. It allows you to create tailored policies between projects to make sure users can only access what they should (which conforms to the least privilege approach). By default, without any network policy resources defined, pods in a project can access any other pod.

To change, edit `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` and `/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml`:

```yaml
. . .
networkConfig:
  networkPluginName:
. . .
```

Example: Both networks are separate projects - The following network policy, which applies to all pods in network-A, allows traffic from the pods in network-B whose label is `role="back-end"`, but blocks all other pods:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: network-A_policy
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: back-end
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: network-B
```

Example: Both networks are separate projects - The following network policy, which applies to network-B, allows traffic from all the pods in network-A. This policy is less restrictive than the network-A policy, because it does not restrict traffic on any pods on the network-A project:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: network-B_policy
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: network-A
```

The following excerpt shows how to allow external users to access an application whose labels match `product-catalog` over a TCP connection on port 8080:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: external-access
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: product-catalog
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
```

```bash
ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0 -O OpenFlow13 --no-stats                     # flow rules on the Open vSwitch bridge on the node
```

The following network policy allows traffic coming from pods that match the `emails` label to access a database whose label is `db`:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: allow-3306
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db                                                         # destination
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: emails                                                 # source
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```

You can also define a default policy for your project. An empty pod selector means that this policy applies to all pods in this project. The following default policy blocks all traffic unless you define an explicit policy that overrides this default behavior:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: default-deny
spec:
  podSelector:
```

To manage network communication between two projects, assign a label to the project that needs access to another project:

```bash
oc label namespace front-end project=frontend_project                 # assigns the frontend_project label to the front-end project
```

The following network policy, which applies to a `back-end` project, allows any pods in the `front-end` project to access the pods labeled as `app=user-registration` through port 8080, in this `back-end` project:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: allow-8080-user-registration
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-registration
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:                                              # can be also 'podSelector:'
        matchLabels:
          project: frontend_project
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
```

**Node & Pod network**

OpenShift configures each cluster node with an Open vSwitch bridge named `br0`. For each pod, OpenShift creates a `veth` device and connects one end to the `eth0` interface inside the pod and the other end to the `br0` bridge:

```bash
nsenter -t 13120 --net ip link show                                   # run as root on the node, 13120 is PID of a process running inside the container. 'eth0@if36:' (connects eth0 inside container to the 36th interface on the node) is one of the links in the output.
ip link show | grep ^36:                                              # retrieve the other end of that veth device - e.g. 'vetha4f3b73f@if3:'
yum install -y openvswitch                                            # not installed by default, good for inspecting the network with ovs-vsctl
ovs-vsctl show | grep vetha4f3b73f                                    # shows the 'br0' and all the connected ports.
```

`tun0` interface on the node is an Open vSwitch port on the `br0` bridge, it is used for external cluster access

OpenShift uses the vxlan_sys_4789 interface on the node, or vxlan0 in br0, for building the cluster overlay network between nodes. Communications between pods on different nodes go through this interface.

**CONTROLLING EGRESS TRAFFIC**

By default, OpenShift allows egress traffic with no restrictions. You can control traffic with egress fw, routers, static IP. OpenShift allows traffic if no rule matches, checks rules in order.

1. Egress FWs
This object allows the egress traffic to the 192.168.12.0/24 network, and to the db-srv.example.com and analytics.example.com systems. The last rule denies everything else. The rules only apply to the egress traffic and do not affect inter-pod communication:

```yaml
kind: EgressNetworkPolicy
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myfirewall
spec:
  egress:
  - to:
      cidrSelector: 192.168.12.0/24
    type: Allow
  - to:
      dnsName: db-srv.example.com
    type: Allow
  - to:
      dnsName: analytics.example.com
    type: Allow
  - to:
      cidrSelector: 0.0.0.0/0
    type: Deny
```

```bash
oc create -f firewall.yaml -n myproject                               # only one per project, you must be cluster admin to create it
```

2. Egress Routers
  3 modes:
    1. Redirect   - image `openshift3/ose-pod` (TCP and UDP)
    2. HTTP proxy - image `openshift3/ose-egress-http-proxy` (HTTP and HTTPS)
    3. DNS proxy  - image `openshift3/ose-egress-dns-proxy` (TCP)

Can be used with any of the three SDN plugins, but underlying hosting platform may need to be reconfigured. Present a unique identifiable source IP address to the firewall and the external service.

Egress router is a particular pod running in your project with two interfaces (eth0, macvlan0). It acts as a proxy between your pods and the external service.

`macvlan0` interfaces are special devices that directly expose node interfaces to the container and has a MAC address seen by the underlying network.

```bash
nsenter -t 14171 --net ip addr show                                   # shows eth0@if22 and macvlan0@if2. IP address of the macvlan interface, 172.25.250.20 is not used by anything else and is the source IP address seen by the external firewall and service
ip link show | grep ^2:                                               # "2: eth0: ..."
```

In front of each egress router, you need to create an OpenShift service object. You use that service host name inside your application to access the external service through the router.

a/ Example - redirect mode (can only be created by cluster admin & application may need reconfiguration to access external service through egress router):

3. Enabling Static IP Addresses for External Access
You can define a static IP address at the project level, in the `NetNamespace` object. With such a configuration, all the egress traffic from the pods in the project originates from that IP address. OpenShift must use the `ovs-networkpolicy` SDN plug-in.

OpenShift automatically creates one `NetNamespace` object per project. First, associate IP with project and then node:

```bash
oc patch netnamespace myproject -p '{"egressIPs": ["172.25.250.19"]}' # associates the unused 172.25.250.19 address to the myproject project
oc get netnamespace myproject
  NAME        NETID     EGRESS IPS
  myproject   13508931  [172.25.250.19]
oc patch hostsubnet node1 -p '{"egressIPs": ["172.25.250.19"]}'       # associates the 172.25.250.19 address to node1 (you must indicate on which node OpenShift should assign the address)
oc get hostsubnet node1                                               # shows EGRESS IPS [172.25.250.19]
ssh root@node1 ip addr show dev eth0                                  # OpenShift declares the address as an alias on the external network interface of node1
```

When using the `oc patch` command to add a new address to a `HostSubnet` object that already has egress IP addresses defined for other projects, you must also specify those addresses in the `egressIPs` array:

```bash
oc patch hostsubnet node1 -p '{"egressIPs": ["172.25.250.19", "172.25.250.16", "172.25.250.15"]}' # otherwise new address replaces/overwrites all the existing ones
```

## 8. Providing Secure Storage I/O

**CATEGORIZING STORAGE TYPES IN OPENSHIFT**

1. Shared storage - GlusterFS, NFS, Ceph..
2. Block storage - EBS, GCE disk, iSCSI..

**Accessing Files in a Shared Storage Type in OpenShift**
If you need to access the same share from multiple pods, then you must configure each pod to use a default GID and define the group ownership of the share with a known GID:

```bash
chgrp test <directory>                                                # configure  dir with known GID
cat /etc/group | grep test                                            # test:x:1012:user
```

To enforce that your pod use a group, you must create a service account in each project. Each service account must be assigned to the same security constraint context (SCC) and it must restrict the limitations to a specific GID. Additionally, because the built-in SCC takes precedence over a custom one, you must set a higher priority in the custom SCC (`kind: SecurityContextConstraints`, `priority: XX`):

```bash
oc create serviceaccount <sccName> -n <projectName>                   # create the service account that configures the project with the custom SCC
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user <sccName> system:serviceaccount:<projectName>:<serviceAccount> # associate the service account with the SCC
```

**Accessing Files in a Block Storage Type in OpenShift**

Any OpenShift cluster can access block storage and even share the contents among pods in the same project. The first pod takes over ownership of the block storage, changing the GID and UID from that share. If any other pod running in the same project tries to access the same persistent volume bound to the block storage, the deployment fails due to lack of permissions.
To solve this problem, you must create a security constraint context that configures the `fsGroup` setting and allows any pod to access the same persistent volume.

## 9. Configuring Web Application Single Sign-on

1. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
2. OpenID Connect
3. JWT

Describing the OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow

1. The application redirects to the SSO server, which presents a login screen and validates the user's credentials.
2. On successful authentication, the SSO redirects back to the application providing a 'code'.
3. The application uses the code to request an access token from SSO server.
4. The SSO server returns an access token that the application uses to authorize end user's requests and to submit requests to other applications that are clients of the same SSO realm.

**CONFIGURING KEYCLOAK ADAPTERS FOR SINGLE SIGN-ON**

The core technology of Red Hat's SSO solution is the Keycloak open source project.

**DESCRIBING SSO CLIENT ACCESS TYPES**

1. 'client protocol' defines whether the application uses SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect
2. 'access type' defines whether the application is required to authenticate itself or not
3. 'valid Redirect URIs' protects the SSO server from sending tokens to applications other than the ones that initiated an authentication request

When you create a pod, OpenShift runs the 'pod' process to create these namespaces and place the container processes in them. This means that all containers in a pod share the same network, the same System V IPC objects, and have the same host name.

**How to find PID in OpenShift?**

```bash
oc describe pod myweb-1-bmmwq | grep 'Container ID'                   # 7084...383d
runc state 7084...383d | grep "pid"                                   # 8997
nsenter -t 8997 -p -r ps -ef                                          # To use the ps command in a container namespace, also specify the -r or --root option to get the same file systems as the container. This is because the ps command uses the /proc file system to list the processes, and it needs to use the one from the container hierarchy and not the one from the host system.
```

**SECURING CONTAINERS WITH SELINUX**

- With OpenShift, containers processes always get the `container_t` context type when they start, and the files and directories the containers need to access on the host system gets the `container_file_t` context type.
- MCS (Multi Category Security) is a SELinux feature that solves issue of containers protect themselves from other container by taking advantage of the level part of the context: `system_u:system_r:container_t:s0:c4,c9` (s0=sensitives, c4,c9=categories). Sensitivity is not used, but categories are. Category values are between `c0` and `c1023` each. When a container starts, the system assigns two random categories to the processes in the container. But OpenShift behaves differently when assigning the SELinux categories - OpenShift allocates the two random categories at the project level. Therefore, and by default, all pods and containers in a project get the same category pair. This is useful when multiple containers in the project need to access the same shared volume.

**MANAGING RESOURCES WITH CGROUPS**

```bash
cat /proc/1938/cgroup                                                 # Systemd automatically organizes its services in control group hierarchies. It places all services under the /system.slice control groups
ls -l /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/system.slice/rsyslog.service/             # this is the standard structure
systemd-cgls                                                          # list all the control groups on the system
tree -d /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/kubepods.slice/                         # this is OpenShift/Kube specific structure
```

**LISTING AVAILABLE LINUX CAPABILITIES & LIMITING THEM**

```bash
capsh --print                                                         # capsh (Capabilities Shell) is a utility for viewing the available capabilities on a system for user running it
cat /proc/<PID>/status | grep Cap                                     # capabilities for process: CaCapInh (inheritable), CapPrm (permitted), CapEff (permission checks), CapBnd (bounding set), CapAmb (ambient)
capsh --decode=0000003fffffffff                                       # decode HEX
capsh --print -- -c "ping -c 1 localhost"                             # contains cap_net_raw among other things
capsh --drop=cap_net_raw --print -- -c "ping -c 1 localhost"          # drops the cap_net_raw capability which makes the ping fail
```

**MANAGING CAPABILITIES IN CONTAINERS**

- Podman possess a set of two options for managing capabilities: `--cap-add` and `--cap-drop`
- Default common capabilities by podman: `cap_chown`, `cap_mknod`, `cap_dac_override`, `cap_audit_write`, `cap_setfcap`, `cap_fsetid`

```bash
podman run --rm -it --name=capabilities rhel7/7.5 capsh --print
podman run --rm -it --cap-add=sys_time --name=test_caps rhel7/7.5 capsh --print # adds change system time capability
```

Avoid `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, which is too broad.

**INTRODUCING SECURE COMPUTING MODE `seccomp`**

- If a process attempts to perform a system call that it is not allowed to performed, the process is terminated according the policy that is in place
- Two modes:
  - A) allows a process to make only four system calls: `read()`, `write()`, `_exit()`, and `sigreturn()`. With this seccomp mode enabled, processes cannot fork new threads, nor monitor network activity.
  - B) seccomp-bpf Kernel extension allows generic system call filtering. For example, you can define a rule that allows a process to only access certain files. seccomp allows you to define a profile that contains a set of filters, which are applied to every system call that submitted from a process to the kernel.

**RESTRICTING PROCESSES WITH `seccomp`**

- To enable seccomp protection, a parent process sets a profile right before forking a child process
- Podman allows you to use the `--security-opt` option to attach a security profile to your container
- Two annotations:
  - A) `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod`
  - B) `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/<container_name>`

An example of the `custom_policy.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
  "architectures": [
    "SCMP_ARCH_X86_64",
    "SCMP_ARCH_X86",
    "SCMP_ARCH_X32"
  ],
  "syscalls": [
    {
      "names": [
        "chroot"
      ],
      "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
      "args": [],
      "comment": "",
      "includes": {
        "caps": [
          "CAP_SYS_CHROOT"
        ]
      },
      "excludes": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

Attach this policy to a container using Podman and test it:

```bash
sudo podman run --rm -it --security-opt seccomp=custom_policy.json --name chroot rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7 chroot / # not permitted
grep Seccomp /proc/10/status                                          # inspect the status file of any child process running inside the container
```

Another example:

```json
. . .
"syscalls": [
  { "name": "fchmodat",
    "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
    "args": []
  },
  { "name": "fchownat",
    "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
    "args": []
  }
]
```

Default seccomp profile

- Provides a sane default for running containers with seccomp and disables around 44 system calls out of 300+. It is moderately protective while providing wide application compatibility. The default Docker profile can be found:

`less /etc/docker/seccomp.json` - defaultAction is deny

```
# 3 actions:
SCMP_ACT_ALLOW
SCMP_ACT_KILL
SCMP_ACT_ERRNO
```

In effect, the profile is a whitelist which denies access to system calls by default, then whitelists specific system calls. The profile works by defining a `defaultAction` of `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` and overriding that action only for specific system calls. The effect of `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` is to cause a `Permission Denied` error. Next, the profile defines a specific list of system calls which are fully allowed, because their `action` is overridden to be `SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`. Finally, some specific rules are for individual system calls such as `personality`, and others, to allow variants of those system calls with specific arguments.

`strace -cf ping 172.25.250.13` shows table with used system calls

```bash
# It is not recommended to change the default seccomp profile, but rather --cap-add or --cap-drop:
podman run --name testsec -dit --security-opt=seccomp=seccomp.json --cap-drop NET_BIND_SERVICE hello-world
podman attach testsec
```

Limitations:

1. Filtering policies apply to the entire pod or container, and not only to the application running inside a container. Consider also the system calls that the container runtime makes when starting the container.
2. OpenShift does not support yet policy precedence. If developer defines custom profile for their containers, it overrides the default profile by OpenShift.

Identifying System Calls that Processes Invoke:

1. Creating a container with the `SYS_PTRACE` capability. This capability allows a container to trace arbitrary processes using ptrace
2. Invoking the strace command from inside the container.
3. Locating the commands that are invoked.
4. Updating the security policy to include all relevant system calls.
5. Instantiating a new container with the updated security profile.

## 2. Establishing Trusted Container Images

**Red Hat OpenShift Platform v3.11 points to the new `registry.redhat.io` registry by default**

```bash
podman login registry.redhat.io                                       # Podman stores your encrypted credentials in a file called /run/user/<UID>/containers/auth.json
skopeo inspect --creds developer1:MyS3cret! docker://registry.redhat.io/rhscl/postgresql-96-rhel7 # Skopeo uses the auth.json file from podman login, but you can alternatively do --creds (or --src-creds/--dest-creds for copy)
podman logout registry.redhat.io
podman logout --all
```

**QUAY**

```bash
podman login quay.apps.lab.example.com
podman pull quay.apps.lab.example.com/developer2/rhel-tools:latest    # or have the rhel-tools public and then you don't need auth
```

**Configuring Jenkins to support Quay integration**

To use Quay as the container image registry, some requirements must be addressed: The Quay repository must use a valid SSL certificate to communicate with OpenShift and Jenkins. If you are using self-signed certificates, each node from OpenShift must have the self-signed certificate in the Quay's certificate directory (`/etc/docker/certs.d/<quay-URI>`). Furthermore, the Jenkins slave container must have the certificate to sign the container image as well as the skopeo command line to push changes to the registry.

### LAB 2.1

```bash
lab containers-registries start
oc login -u admin -p redhat https://master.lab.example.com
oc project quay-enterprise                                            # groups all resources of Quay
oc get pods                                                           # Quay does not support running the database on OpenShift, but in the lab it does (you'll see clair, clair-postgresql, quay, quay-postgresql, redis)
oc get routes                                                         # e.g. https://quay.apps.lab.example.com
# Configure Quay here via web GUI (admin/redhat123) - create user, change password, create organisation
podman login quay.apps.lab.example.com                                # on the workstation
skopeo copy docker://registry.lab.example.com/httpd:latest docker://quay.apps.lab.example.com/exampledev/httpd:latest
podman logout quay.apps.lab.example.com
sudo -i
podman login quay.apps.lab.example.com                                # as developer1
podman pull quay.apps.lab.example.com/exampledev/httpd:latest
podman logout quay.apps.lab.example.com
lab containers-registries finish
```

**Using Images Annotations for Security**

```text
<namespace containing image's quality>/<vulnerability|policy>.<provider ID>
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.redhatcatalog: {SEE THE EXAMPLE BELOW}
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.jfrog: {SEE THE EXAMPLE BELOW}
quality.images.openshift.io/license.blackduck: {SEE THE EXAMPLE BELOW}
quality.images.openshift.io/vulnerability.openscap: {SEE THE EXAMPLE BELOW}
```

Each annotation supports these fields:

- name (provider display name),
- timestamp of the scan,
- description (not required),
- reference,
- scannerVersion,
- compliant (yes x no),
- summary (label [critical/important], data, severityIndex, reference)

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Red Hat Container Catalog",
  "description": "Container health index",
  "timestamp": "2016-09-08T05:04:46Z",
  "reference": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2016:1566",
  "compliant": null,
  "scannerVersion": "1.2",
  "summary": [
    {
      "label": "Health index",
      "data": "B",
      "severityIndex": 1,
      "reference": null
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
oc describe is <image stream> -n openshift                            # read the status of an image stream to see the annotation
```

The annotation `images.openshift.io/deny-execution=true` is added by a security scanner, to define a policy that admission plugin prevents images from being retrieved if they are not marked as compliant: `vim /etc/origin/master/master-config.yml`:

```yaml
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    openshift.io/ImagePolicy:
      configuration:
        kind: ImagePolicyConfig
        apiVersion: v1
        resolveImages: AttemptRewrite
        executionRules:
        - name: execution-denied
          onResources:
          - resource: pods
          reject: true
          matchImageAnnotations:                                      # <-- important
          - key: images.openshift.io/deny-execution                   # <-- important
            value: "true"                                             # <-- important
          skipOnResolutionFailure: true
```

`master-restart api`
`master-restart controllers`

**Image signing and verification**

- Signer server is the host responsible for generating the signature that embeds the image manifest digest and publish the signature to the signatures server
- On the server, the `/etc/containers/registries.d/registry.yaml` location contains configuration files that specify where signatures are stored after their generation and where to download signature for each registry - e.g. `registry.yaml`:

```yaml
docker:
  registry.example.com:
    sigstore-staging: file:///var/lib/atomic/sigstore                 # stores new sigs under the filesystem
    sigstore: http://sigstore.lab.example.com                         # retrieves them from web
```

Configure clients (nodes pulling images) - you can have different policies for different nodes:

```bash
vim /etc/containers/policy.json                                       # images require signatures?
```

Allow only images from the registry.lab.example.com server. All other images are rejected:

```json
{
  "default": [
    {
      "type": "reject"
    }
  ],
  "transports": {
    "docker-daemon": {
      "": [
        {
          "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
        }
      ]
    },
    "docker": {
      "registry.lab.example.com": [
        {
          "type": "signedBy",
          "keyType": "GPGKeys",
          "keyPath": "/home/signer/pub/image-signer-pub.gpg"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Inspecting image layers**

```bash
mkdir /tmp/mongo
skopeo copy docker://registry.lab.example.com/rhscl/mongodb-32-rhel7 dir:/tmp/mongo # extracts the rhscl/mongodb-32-rhel7 image in the /tmp/mongo/ directory

tar xf /tmp/mongo/9205...f599 -C /tmp/layer                           # layer is a compressed tar file
ls /tmp/layer                                                         # bin/ boot/ dev/ ..., other layers only contain additions or modifications to those base directories
```

**Introducing Clair**

```bash
oc logs clair-2-bfp2c | grep fetching                                 # Clair log shows the retrieval of the vulnerability metadata from the Internet
```

- Clair only analyses images based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Alpine Linux, Debian, Oracle Linux, and Ubuntu because it only retrieves the vulnerabilities from these system vendors or projects
- Clair also limits its scan to the distribution packages and does NOT check vulnerabilities in your application code, or libraries or artifacts retrieved from other sources

## 3. Implementing Security in the Build Process

**Implementing Image Change Triggers**

```bash
oc set triggers bc build-config-name --from-image="image:tag"       # change made to that image stream automatically starts a build process, this configures image change trigger in an existing build config.

# The hook fails if the script or command returns a non-zero exit code or if starting the temporary container fails. In that case, the image is not pushed to the registry.
oc set build-hook bc/build-config-name --post-commit --command -- <command> # create build hook in an existing bc (or instead of --command, use --script="/path/to/script")
```

**Ensure Jenkins is deployed**

```bash
oc new-app jenkins --param ENABLE_OAUTH=true                          # deploy Jenkins container with persistent storage and use the OCP credentials to log in to it
```

To create Jenkins pipeline, you have to create this resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
//omitted
strategy:
  jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
    jenkinsfile: |-
    def mvnCmd = "mvn -s configuration/cicd-settings.xml"
    pipeline {
      agent {
        label 'maven'
      }
    //stages omitted
    }
  }
  type: JenkinsPipeline
```

```bash
oc create -f definition.yaml
oc start-build buildconfig-name
```

Integration point in a Jenkins Pipeline - slave hosts are started as containers using a Jenkins Kubernetes plugin:

- `<name>` is the name of the slave used in Jenkinsfile (agent - label)
- `<image>` is the container image to start the build process, there are many types of Jenkins slaves

Example of the agent definition:

```yaml
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  data:
    maven-template: |-
      <org.csanchez.jenkins.plugins.kubernetes.PodTemplate>
        <inheritFrom></inheritFrom>
        <name>maven</name>                                            # slave name used by Jenkins pipeline
        #configuration omitted
        <org.csanchez.jenkins.plugins.kubernetes.ContainerTemplate>
          <name>jnlp</name>
          <image>registry.lab.example.com/openshift/jenkins-agent-maven-35-centos7</image> # image used to start build process
  # configuration omitted
  </org.csanchez.jenkins.plugins.kubernetes.ContainerTemplate>
```

## 4. Managing User Access Control

RBAC resources:

- Users = can make requests to OpenShift API
- Service Accounts = used for delegating certain tasks to OpenShift
- Groups
- Roles = collections of rules
- Rules = define verbs that users/groups can use with a given resource
- Security Context Constraints = control the actions pod/container can perform
- Role bindings = roles to users/groups

```text
oc describe clusterrole admin
  Name: admin
  Created:  5 weeks ago
  Labels: kubernetes.io/bootstrapping=rbac-defaults
  Annotations:  openshift.io/description=A user that has edit rights within the project and can change the project's membership.
      openshift.io/reconcile-protect=false

  Verbs                     (...)     Resources
  [delete get patch update] (...)     [projects]                      # user can retrieve list of projects, delete/modify them
  [get list watch]          (...)     [namespaces]
```

Two levels:

1. Cluster-wide RBAC - applicable across all projects
2. Local RBAC - apply to a given project

```text
oc describe rolebinding admin -n developer                            # access local role bindings
  Name: admin
  Namespace:  developer
  Created:  9 minutes ago
  Labels: <none>
  Annotations:  <none>
  Role: /admin
  Users:  developer
  Groups: <none>
  ServiceAccounts:  <none>
  Subjects: <none>

  Verbs             (...) Resources
  [get list watch]  (...) [namespaces]
  [impersonate]     (...) [serviceaccounts]
  ...output omitted...
```

The following excerpt shows how to include a SCC to a role. This gives privileges to the user or the group that uses this role to access the `restricted-scc` security context constraint:

```yaml
rules:
  apiGroups:
  - security.openshift.io
  resources:
  - securitycontextconstraints                                        # name of the resource group that allows you to include a SCC in the role
  verbs:
  - use
  resourceNames:
  - restricted-scc                                                    # name of the SCC that is applied to all pods or containers that inherit this role
```

```bash
# Some of the defaults cluster roles that are available in OpenShift - e.g.:
oc describe clusterrole self-provisioner

# Groups & users
oc adm groups new <group_name> <user_name>
oc create user <user_name>

# Managing Roles
oc create role <name> --verb=<verb> --resource=<resource type> -n <project> # local role for a project
oc create clusterrole <name> --verb=<verb> --resource=<resource>      # cluster role

oc create role manager --verb=create,get,delete --resource=pod,service -n cicd
oc adm policy add-role-to-user manager developer -n cicd
```

A good list with all resources and verbs: `oc describe clusterrole.rbac`

Some examples of the role definition:

- This "Role" is allowed to read the resource "Pods" in the core API group:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: read-pods-within-ns
  namespace: default
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - pods
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
```

- This "Role" is allowed to read and write the "Deployments" in both the "extensions" and "apps" API groups:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: read-write-deployment-in-ext-and-apps-apis
  namespace: default
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - extensions
      - apps
    resources:
      - deployments
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
```

- This "Role" is allowed to read "Pods" and read/write "Jobs" resources in API groups:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: read-pods-and-read-write-jobs
  namespace: default
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - pods
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
  - apiGroups:
      - batch
      - extensions
    resources:
      - jobs
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - create
      - update
      - patch
      - delete
```

- This "Role" is allowed to read a "ConfigMap" named "my-config" (must be bound with a "RoleBinding" to limit to a single "ConfigMap" in a single namespace):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: read-configmap-within-ns
  namespace: default
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - configmaps
    resourceNames:
      - my-config
    verbs:
      - get
```

- This "ClusterRole" is allowed to read the resource "nodes" in the core group (because a Node is cluster-scoped, this must be bound with a "ClusterRoleBinding" to be effective):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: read-nodes
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ''
    resources:
      - nodes
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
```

- This "ClusterRole" is allowed to "GET" and "POST" requests to the non-resource endpoint "/healthz" and all subpaths (must be in the "ClusterRole" bound with a "ClusterRoleBinding" to be effective):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: get-and-post-to-non-resource-endpoints
rules:
  - nonResourceURLs:
      - /healthz
      - /healthz/*
    verbs:
      - get
      - post
```

```bash

oc auth can-i create deploymentconfigs                                # yes
oc auth can-i delete users                                            # no - no RBAC policy matched

```

**INTRODUCING TOKENS**

```bash

**CONFIGURING AN OPENSHIFT IDENTITY PROVIDER FOR RED HAT IDENTITY MANAGEMENT (IdM)**

- OpenShift masters can be configured with different identity providers that allow an OpenShift cluster to delegate user authentication and group membership management to different identity stores.
- To configure an OpenShift `LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider` identity provider to integrate with an IdM domain, you need the following information about your IdM domain and servers:
    - DNS domain name of your IdM domain (`organization.example.com`)
    - FQDN of one of your IdM servers (`ldap1.organization.example.com`)
    - LDAP user name with read access of the entire user accounts tree (`uid=admin,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com`)
    - LDAP container of the user accounts tree (`cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com`)
    - public key TLS certificate of your IdM domain (`/etc/ipa/ca.crt` file in any server or client of your IdM domain)
- Example stanza under the `identityProviders` attribute on the OpenShift master configuration file `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml`:

```yaml
. . .
identityProviders:
- challenge: true
  login: true
  mappingMethod: claim
  name: idm_ldap_auth                                                 # can be anything
  provider:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider
    attributes:
      id:
      - dn
      preferredUsername:
      - uid
    insecure: false                                                   # use TLS, refuse invalid certs
    ca: /etc/origin/master/idm-domain-ca.crt                          # public key TLS cert of the IdM domain
    url: "ldaps://server1.organization.example.net:636/cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com?uid" # LDAP search URL for user accounts
    bindDN: "uid=admin,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com" # username
    bindPassword: "secret"                                            # password
```

**SYNCHRONIZING GROUPS BETWEEN OPENSHIFT AND IdM**

```bash
oc adm groups sync --confirm                                          # run regularly to keep OpenShift and LDAP groups in sync
oc adm groups sync --help                                             # whitelist & blacklist!
    # Sync all groups from an LDAP server
    oc adm groups sync --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm # see LDAPSyncConfig

    # Sync all groups except the ones from the blacklist file from an LDAP server
    oc adm groups sync --blacklist=/path/to/blacklist.txt --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm

    # Sync specific groups specified in a whitelist file with an LDAP server
    oc adm groups sync --whitelist=/path/to/whitelist.txt --sync-config=/path/to/sync-config.yaml --confirm

    # Sync all OpenShift Groups that have been synced previously with an LDAP server
    oc adm groups sync --type=openshift --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm

    # Sync specific OpenShift Groups if they have been synced previously with an LDAP server
    oc adm groups sync groups/group1 groups/group2 groups/group3 --sync-config=/path/to/sync-config.yaml --confirm

  Options:
    --blacklist='': path to the group blacklist file
    --confirm=false: if true, modify OpenShift groups; if false, display results of a dry-run
    --sync-config='': path to the sync config
    --type='ldap': which groups white- and blacklist entries refer to: ldap,openshift
    --whitelist='': path to the group whitelist file

oc adm groups prune --confirm                                         # deletes all current orphan groups from OpenShift
```

**Configuring LDAP Synchronization Connection Parameters (similar to LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider):**

```yaml
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
url: ldaps://server1.organization.example.com:636                     # LDAP URI FQDN
bindDN: uid=admin,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com # username
bindPassword: secret                                                  # plaintext password
insecure: false                                                       # not allowing insecure communication and thus forcing TLS
ca: /home/student/idm-ca.crt                                          # must exist on the client where you run the 'oc'
augmentedActiveDirectory:                                             # variation of MS AD schema
  groupsQuery:
    baseDN: "cn=groups,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com" # user account container
    scope: sub
    derefAliases: never
    pageSize: 0
  groupUIDAttribute: dn
  groupNameAttributes: [ cn ]
  usersQuery:
    baseDN: "cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=organization,dc=example,dc=com"  # groups container
    scope: sub
    derefAliases: never
    filter: (objectclass=inetOrgPerson)
    pageSize: 0
userNameAttributes: [ uid ]
groupMembershipAttributes: [ memberOf ]
```

**MANAGING OPENSHIFT USERS AND IDENTITIES**

- You may need to delete the identity resource for a user if the same user name exists on different identity providers.

```bash
oc get user
  NAME    ...   IDENTITIES
  admin   ...   htpasswd_auth:admin
  idmuser ...   idm_ldap_auth:uid=idmuser,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=...
```

OpenShift retains identities for deleted users, and these identities may prevent a new user from logging in, if that user has the same name of an old user:

```bash
oc delete user idmuser
oc delete identity idm_ldap_auth:uid=idmuser,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=...
```

**DEPLOYING SINGLE SIGN-ON ON OPENSHIFT**

Passthrough vs. re-encryption SSO templates

Typically coming from `registry.redhat.io/redhat-sso-7/sso72-openshift:1.0` (or v1.1, v1.2 ...)

To integrate an application with Red Hat's SSO server you define and configure, at minimum, one 'realm', one or more 'clients', and one or more 'users':

1. Web console: `https://sso-fqdn/auth/admin`
2. `/bin/kadm.sh`

**CONFIGURING AN OPENSHIFT IDENTITY PROVIDER FOR SSO**

The `OpenIDIdentityProvider` identity provider allows OpenShift to delegate authentication to a SSO server using the OpenID Connect standard (`master-config.yml`):

```yaml
. . .
identityProviders:
- challenge: true
  login: true
  mappingMethod: claim
  name: sso_realm                                                     # name of your choice
  provider:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: OpenIDIdentityProvider
    clientID: MyApp                                                   # client ID of existing client on the SSO realm
    clientSecret: 41b5677d-09b1-4ffc-890a-99f10204bde9                # secret of the SSO client
    ca: /etc/origin/master/ca-bundle.crt                              # absolute path on the master
    urls:
      authorize: https://sso.server.example.com/auth/realms/MyRealm/protocol/openid-connect/auth
      token: https://sso.server.lab.example.com/auth/realms/MyRealm/protocol/openid-connect/token
      userInfo: https://sso.server.lab.example.com/auth/realms/MyRealm/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
    claims:
      id:
      - sub
      preferredUsername:
      - preferred_username
      name:
      - name
      email:
      - email
```

The OpenID Connect API endpoints of your SSO realm, that follow the format: `https://<sso-server-fqdn>/auth/realms/<RealmName>/protocol/openid-connect/<operation>`

operation = Name of an OpenID Connect API operation, such as 'auth', 'token', and 'userinfo'

```bash
curl -sk https://sso-server-fqdn/auth/realms/RealmName /.well-known/openid-configuration | python -m json.tool # lists all URLs for a SSO realm, for example the RealmName realm
```

## 5. Controlling the Deployment Environment

**REVIEWING SECRETS AND CONFIGMAPS**

- You can store the registry credentials in a secret and instruct OpenShift to use that secret when it needs to push and pull images from the registry.

**SECRETS**

Individual secrets are limited to 1MB in size.

```bash
oc create secret generic secret_name --from-literal=username=operator --from-literal=password=MyS3cr3T
```

Or in YAML:

```bash
echo operator | base64                                                # b3BlcmF0b3IK
echo MyS3cr3T | base64                                                # TXlTM2NyM1QK
vim secret.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret_name
data:
  username: b3BlcmF0b3IK                                              # must be base64 encoded
  password: TXlTM2NyM1QK                                              # must be base64 encoded
```

```bash
oc create -f secret.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: test-secret
  namespace: my-namespace
type: Opaque                                                          # bypasses any validation
data:
  password: dmFsdWUtMQ0K                                              # must be base64 encoded
stringData:
  hostname: myapp.mydomain.com
  admin_password: redhat123                                           # plain text value will automatically be converted to base64
```

How to use the above secret in the deployment config:

```yaml
...output omitted...
env:
- name: APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD                                            # environment variable retrieves value from test-secret secret
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:                                                     # similarly to configMapKeyRef
      name: test-secret
      key: admin_password
```

Another use case is the passing of data, such as TLS certificates, to an application by using the `--from-file=file` option. This exposes a sensitive file to an application. The pod definition can reference the secret, which creates the secret as files in a volume mounted on one or more of the application containers.

```yaml
...output omitted...
      spec:
        containers:
...output omitted...
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /conf/app/extra_ca_certs                       # mounts certs_volume to /conf/app/extra_ca_certs
            name: certs_volume
        volumes:
        - name: certs_volume
          secret:
            defaultMode: 420
            secretName: application-certificates                      # maps the volume to application_certificates secret
```

**CONFIGURATION MAP**

```bash
oc create configmap special-config --from-literal=serverAddress=172.20.30.40
```

Or in YAML:

```bash
vim special-config.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: special-config
data:
  serverAddress: 172.20.30.40
```

```bash
oc create -f special-config.yaml
```

Populate the APISERVER environment variable inside a pod definition from the above configuration map:

```yaml
env:
- name: APISERVER
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:                                                  # similarly to secretKeyRef
      name: special-config
      key: serverAddress
```

**Encrypting Secrets in Etcd**

1. On master nodes, define the experimental-encryption-provider-config in the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
...output omitted...
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    experimental-encryption-provider-config:                          # <-- important
    - /etc/origin/master/encryption-config.yaml                       # <-- important
    storage-backend:
    - etcd3
...output omitted...
```

2. Create `encryption-config.yaml` file: `vim /etc/origin/master/encryption-config.yaml`

```yaml
kind: EncryptionConfig
apiVersion: v1
resources:
  - resources:
    - secrets:
    providers:
    - aescbc:                                                         # algorithm used, strongest cypher
      keys:
      - name: key1
        secret: hifzYhVwbOFYL7X+oGoEqwblf94sJFoVg7IOECcCk+Q=          # base64 encoded and 32-byte length
    - identity: {}
```

```bash
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64                                      # random secret used above as key1
master-restart api
master-restart controllers
# From now on, new secret object are encrypted:
etcdctl3 get /kubernetes.io/secrets/mytest/mysecret2 -w fields --cacert=/etc/etcd/ca.crt --key=/etc/etcd/peer.key --cert=/etc/etcd/peer.crt --endpoints 'https://172.25.250.10:2379' | grep Value
# If you need to encrypt already existing secrets:
oc adm migrate storage --include=secrets --confirm                    # reads all secrets then updates them to apply server-side encryption
```

**Preparing Secrets for Accessing Authenticated Registry**

```bash
oc create secret docker-registry <secret_name> --docker-username=<user> --docker-password=<pass> --docker-server=<registry_full_host_name>
```

With Quay, you can create robot accounts (tokens) and grant them access to the repositories in an organization. Quay can generate a YAML Kubernetes resource file that you can also use with OpenShift (`oc create -f ~/Downloads/myorg-openshift-secret.yml`).

**Configuring Project Service Account for Image PUSHING**

The build process uses the OpenShift builder service account in your project. For the builder service account to automatically use that secret for authentication, link it to the secret:

```bash
oc secrets link serviceaccount/builder secret/<secret_name>
oc new-build GIT_project_URL --push-secret=<secret_name> --to-docker --to=<remote_registry>/<namespace>/<image> # S2I build process will now push to another registry
```

**Configuring Project Service Account for Image PULLING**

```bash
oc secrets link serviceaccount/default secret/<secret_name> --for=pull # link default SA in your project to the secret
```

**Configuring OpenShift for Accepting Certificates Signed by a Private CA**

1. Install CA's certificate on each node, under the `/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry_full_host_name>/` directory:

```bash
mkdir /etc/docker/certs.d/quay.apps.lab.example.com/
mv -v ca.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/quay.apps.lab.example.com/
```

2. And on the master you need to do:

```bash
# v3.10 and later:
# Configure the OpenShift API Server to use the CA's certificate, on the master you do:
cat myca.crt >> /etc/origin/master/ca-bundle.crt
# Path to the /etc/origin/master/ca-bundle.crt file is defined by the 'additionalTrustedCA' variable in /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml. So if there is a reference to 'additionalTrustedCA' in the 'imageImportPolicy' section of the master config, you need to do for example:
cat myca.crt >> /etc/origin/master/additional_ca.crt
master-restart api
```

Or:

```bash
# v3.11.43 and later:
oc version                                                            # v3.11?
# in addition to the certificates in /etc/origin/master/ca-bundle.crt, the API server also trusts the certificates in the system /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt file, to automatically append:
mv -v ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
update-ca-trust extract                                               # this will append the CA to the file
```

**LIMITING REGISTRIES, PROJECTS, AND IMAGES**

```bash
cat /etc/containers/policy.json                                       # on all nodes, no need to restart when changed, default file accepts any image:
```

```json
{
  "default": [
    {
      "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
    }
  ],
  "transports":
    {
      "docker-daemon":
      {
        "": [{"type":"insecureAcceptAnything"}]
      }
    }
}
```

- system uses the default entry when no other rule matches
- `insecureAcceptAnything` = accept any image
- `reject` = refuse all images (usually set this requirement in the default entry and add specific rules to allow your images)
- `signedBy` = accept signed images (provide additional parameters such as the public GPG key to use to verify signatures)
- Using wildcards or partial names does NOT work!
- Under the `transports` section file groups registries by type: `docker` (Registry v2 API), `atomic` (OCR), `docker-daemon` (local daemon storage):

Another example:

```json
{
    "default": [
        {
            "type": "reject"                                          <-- reject all images if no other rule matches
        }
    ],
    "transports": {
        "docker": {
            "registry.access.redhat.com": [                           <-- use any images from registr.access.redhat.com as long as they are GPG signed
                {
                    "type": "signedBy",
                    "keyType": "GPGKeys",
                    "keyPath": "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release"
                }
            ],
            "quay.apps.lab.example.com/production": [                 <-- use any image from the production organization in Quay
                {
                    "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
                }
            ],
            "quay.apps.lab.example.com/staging/mypostgres-95:latest": [ <-- pull latest tag of the mypostgresl image in the staging of Quay
                {
                    "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
                }
            ]
        },
        "atomic": {
            "172.30.13.172:5000": [                                   <-- pull any image from the local OpenShift Container Registry (OCR)
                {
                    "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
                }
            ]
        },
        "docker-daemon": {
            "": [
                {
                    "type": "insecureAcceptAnything"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

**Configuring Signature Transports**

That above configuration (`"type"`, `"keyType"`, `"keyPath"`) is not enough; you also need to indicate the URL to the web server that stores the detached image signatures. To declare that URL, create a file under `/etc/containers/registries.d/` such as:

```bash
cat /etc/containers/registries.d/redhat.yaml
docker:
  registry.access.redhat.com:
    sigstore: https://access.redhat.com/webassets/docker/content/sigstore
```

For the OpenShift Container Registry, that you define with the 'atomic' transport type, you do not need to perform this extra configuration. The OCR has API extensions to store the signatures, and the atomic transport type consumes them.

**USING DEPLOYMENT TRIGGERS**

```bash
oc get dc                                                             # look at 'TRIGGERED BY' column
```

For example if it says `config,image(redis:latest)`, there are two types of triggers:

1. A configuration change trigger causes a new deployment to be created any time you update the deployment configuration object itself.
2. An image change trigger causes OpenShift to redeploy the application each time a new version of the redis:latest image is available in the registry

When you create an application with the `oc new-app` command, or from the web interface, OpenShift creates a deployment configuration object with the above two triggers already defined.

This is how it looks like in the YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.openshift.io/v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
...output omitted...
  triggers:
  - type: ConfigChange
  - type: ImageChange
    imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true
      containerNames:
      - <container_name>
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: <image_stream_name>:latest
        namespace: <image_stream_project>
  template:
...output omitted...
```

```bash
# Use the oc set triggers command on an existing deployment configuration object:
oc set triggers dc/<dc_name> --from-image=<image_stream_project>/<image_stream_name>:latest -c <container_name>
# Use the oc import-image command to create an image stream object from an image in a remote repository (and poll regularly):
oc import-image <image_stream_name> --from=<registry_full_host_name>/<namespace>/<image_name> --confirm --scheduled=true
# Follow the triggering of new deployments (similar to 'Events' column in oc describe dc <dc_name>):
oc rollout history dc/<dc_name>
```

**CUSTOMIZING OPENSHIFT PIPELINES**

1. Clone a Git repository and execute a Maven build and installation:

  ```text
  stage('Build App') {
    steps {
      git url: 'http://services.lab.example.com/bookstore'
      sh "mvn install -DskipTests=true"
    }
  }
  ```

2. Submit the code for analysis to a SonarQube instance:

  ```text
  stage('Code Analysis') {
    steps {
      script {
        sh "mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.host.url=http://sonarqube:9000 -DskipTests=true"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

3. Input command asks the user for confirmation:

  ```text
  stage('Promote to QA?') {
    steps {
      timeout(time:15, unit:'MINUTES') {
        input message: "Promote to QA?", ok: "Promote"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

4. Pipeline can also make calls to OpenShift - this rolls out the deployment of the application latest image in the `bookstore-qa` project:

  ```text
  stage('Deploy QA') {
    steps {
      script {
        openshift.withCluster() {
          openshift.withProject('bookstore-qa') {
            openshift.selector('dc', 'bookstore').rollout().latest()
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### LAB 5.1

```

**SECURITY CONTEXT CONSTRAINTS (SCCs)**

- SCCs define conditions that a pod must satisfy in order to be created
- Similar to policies, which enforce certain actions or prevent others from a service or a user (or service account)
- By default resources get `restricted` SCC (no root, mknod, setuid)
- Create your own SCC rather than modifying a predefined SCC

Control:

1. Privileged mode - running privileged containers should be avoided at all costs
2. Privileges escalation - on/off privileges escalation inside a container
3. Linux capabilities - Linux capabilities to and from your containers (e.g. KILL)
4. Seccomp profiles - allow or block certain system calls (e.g. CAP_CHOWN)
5. Volume types - permit or prevent certain volume types (e.g. emptyDir)
6. System control (Sysctl) settings - modify kernel parameters at runtime
7. Host resources - permit or prevent a pod for accessing the following host resources: IPC namespaces, host networks, host ports, and host PID namespaces
8. Read-only root file system - forces users to mount a volume if they need to store data
9. User and group IDs - restricting users to a certain set of ID or GIDs. Each project gets assigned its own range, as defined by a project annotation, such as `openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range=1000190000/10000` and `openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups=1000190000/10000`. `/`=number of allowed values (e.g. 1000190000 up to 1000200000).
10. SELinux labels - define an SELinux label to the pods
11. File system groups - allows you to define supplemental groups for the user, which is usually required for accessing a block device

**Introducing SCC Strategies**

Categories:

1. Boolean (`Allow Privileged: true`)
2. Allowable set (`RequiredDropCapabilites: KILL,MKNOD,SETUID,SETGID`)
3. Controlled by a strategy, SCC Strategies:
    1. `RunAsAny` - any ID defined in the pod definition (or image) is allowed (security issue), no SELinux labels
    2. `MustRunAsRange` - the project or the pod must provide a range within an allowable set, lowest value is default
        - Run As User Strategy:

          ```text
          MustRunAsRange
          UID: <none>
          UID Range Min: 10000000
          UID Range Max:10000100
          ```

    3. `MustRunAs` - project or the pod must provide a single value, for example SELinux context

**Managing Supplemental Groups - shared storage example (e.g. NFS)**

```bash
# You should not be running containers as root, only containers with an UID of 100001 or members of the group with the ID of 100099 are permitted to access the NFS storage:
oc describe demo-project
  ...output omitted...
  Annotations: openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups=1000190000/10000 # default range in OpenShift
  ...output omitted...
ls -lZ /opt/app/nfs -d                                                # NFS server defines a directory accessible by the user ID 100001 and the group ID 100099
```

Annotation is used by OpenShift to determine the range for supplemental groups.

I. One way to allow access to the NFS share is to be explicit in the pod definition by defining a supplemental groups that all containers inherit. All containers that are created in the project are then members of the group 100099, which grants access to the volume, regardless of the container's user ID:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
...output omitted...
spec:
  containers:
  - name: application
  securityContext:
    supplementalGroups: [ 100099 ]                                    # arra of supplemental group(s)
...output omitted...
```

```bash
oc rsh application-pod id
  uid=1000190000 gid=0(root) groups=0(root),100099,1000190000
# You must also ensure that the value is within the allowable range. This is enforced if the strategy for supplemental groups is set to MustRunAsRange. You must then ensure that the SCC applied to the pod allows this value.
```

II. Another solution is the creation of a custom SCC that defines a range for the group IDs, enforces the usage of a value inside the range, allows the GID 100099:

```yaml

**Managing File System Groups - block storage example (e.g. iSCSI)**

Unlike shared storage, block storage is taken over by a pod, which means that the user and group IDs supplied in the pod definition are applied to the physical block device. If the pod uses a restricted SCC that defines a `fsGroup` with a strategy of `MustRunAs`, then the pod will fail to run. OpenShift doesn't allocate any GID to block storage, so if the pod definition doesn't explicitly set `fsGroup` and SCC uses RunAsAny, permission may still be denied! Define a file system group in the pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
...output omitted...
spec:
  containers:
  - name: application
  securityContext:
    fsGroup: [ 600 ]                                                  # filesystem group applied to the block storage
...output omitted...
```

**Managing SELinux context with SCCs**

Restricted SCC defines a strategy of `MustRunAs`, the project must define the options, such as user, role, type, and level otherwise pod will not be created

At creation time, OpenShift assigns a SELinux type to containers' main process, `container_runtime_t`

Define the values for the SELinux context in SCC and relationship with the project:

```text
oc describe scc restricted
  ...output omitted..
  SELinux Context Strategy: MustRunAs
    User: <none>
    Role: <none>
    Type: <none>
    Level: <none>
oc describe project default
  ...output omitted...
  Annotations: openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs=s0:c1,c0
```

If the pod needs to access a volume, the same categories must be defined for the volume. Define the SELinux context for a pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  ...output omitted...
  securityContext:
    seLinuxOptions:
      level: "s0:c123,c456"                                           # sensitivity 0, categories 123,456 = same must be on the volume
```

runAsUser:

```

```bash
oc create -f custom-scc.yaml
oc describe scc custom-scc
# In order to use a custom seccomp profile, you need to enable the seccomp-profile-root directive in the kubeletArguments section of the nodes' configuration file /etc/origin/node/node-config.yml to point to a directory that contains seccomp profiles. The file must be present on all nodes + systemctl restart origin-node:
# kubeletArguments:
#   seccomp-profile-root:
#     - "/path/to/profile"
oc delete scc custom-scc
```

**Managing Service Accounts for SCCs**

Service accounts can be member of an SCC, similarly to users. This restricts all resources created by a service account to inherit the restrictions of the SCC. By default, pods run with the default service account, unless you specify a different service account. All authenticated users are automatically added to the system:authenticated group. As such, all authenticated users inherit the restricted SCC:

```bash
oc describe scc restricted | grep 'Groups:'                           # system:authenticated
```

If a container requires elevated privileges or special privileges, create a new service account and make it member of an existing SCC, or create your own SCC and make the service account member of that SCC. Every service account has an associated user name, so it can be added to any specific SCC.

Creating a custom service account and make it member of the anyuid SCC, which allows pods to use any UID:

```bash
oc create serviceaccount app-sa
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z app-sa                        # -z=service account in the current project
# If you need to add a SCC to the service account from another project (demo-project):
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:demo-project:app-sa
# Update an existing deployment configuration or pod definition:
  ...output omitted...
  spec:
    containers:
      - image: registry-demo.lab.example.com/my-app:latest
        name: my-app
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: app-sa                                      # <--
```

## 6. Managing Secure Platform Orchestration

**MANAGING APPLICATION HEALTH**

1. Liveness Probe - is the pod healthy?
2. Readiness Probe - is the pod ready to serve requests?

**MANAGING APPLICATION SCHEDULING**

Scheduler filters the list of running nodes by the availability of node resources, such as host ports or memory

A common use for affinity rules is to schedule related pods to be close to each other for performance reasons.

A common use case for anti-affinity rules is to schedule related pods not too close to each other for high availability reasons.

Rules can be: mandatory (required) or best-effort (preferred)

Define 8 nodes, two regions, us-west and us-east, and a set of two zones in each region:

```bash
oc label node node1 region=us-west zone=power1a                       # west
oc label node node2 region=us-west zone=power1a
oc label node node3 region=us-west zone=power2a
oc label node node4 region=us-west zone=power2a
oc label node node5 region=us-east zone=power1b                       # east
oc label node node6 region=us-east zone=power1b
oc label node node7 region=us-east zone=power2b
oc label node node8 region=us-east zone=power2b
oc get nodes -L zone -L region                                        # inspect the labels assigned to nodes
```

Rule that requires the pod be placed on a node with a label whose key is `compute-CA-NorthSouth` and whose value is either `compute-CA-North` or `compute-CA-South`:

`oc label node9 compute-CA-NorthSouth=compute-CA-North`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: with-node-affinity
spec:
  affinity:                                                           # different from nodeSelector
    nodeAffinity:                                                     # defines usage of affinity
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:                 # it requires rule to enforce placement. 'required' can also be 'preferred', but then you also need 'weight' value
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:                                           # must match this
          - key: compute-CA-NorthSouth
            operator: In                                              # In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist, Lt, Gt
            values:
            - compute-CA-North                                        # first value that must match
            - compute-CA-South                                        # second value that must match to apply the rule
  containers:
  - name: with-node-affinity
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7
```

Node selector can be part of pod definition or deployment config (the below triggers new deployment):

```bash
oc patch dc dev-app --patch '{"spec":{"template":{"nodeSelector":{"env":"dev"}}}}' # configure the dev-app deployment configuration so that its pods only run on nodes that have the env=dev label
```

Same in YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:                                                       # different from affinity
    env: dev
  containers:
    - image: registry.lab.example.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7:latest
...output omitted...
```

**Node maintenance/availability**

```bash
oc adm manage-node --schedulable=false <node>                         # mark a node as unschedulable
oc adm drain <node> --delete-local-data --ignore-daemonsets           # destroys (evicts) all pods running on the node and instructs OpenShift to recreate the pods, --delete-local-data is for emptyDir pods
```

**MANAGING RESOURCE USAGE**

Define limits in a deployment configuration instead of a pod definition

1. Resource requests - indicate that a pod cannot run with less than the specified amount of resources (essentially requirements)
2. Resource limits - prevent a pod from using up all compute resources from a node

**Managing Quotas**

`ResourceQuota` resource object specifies hard resource usage limits for a project; all attributes of a quota are optional, meaning that any resource that is not restricted by a quota can be consumed without bounds (you can restrict e.g. pods, rc, svc, secrets, pvcs, CPU, memory, storage).

`ClusterResourceQuota` resource is created at the cluster level, uses `openshift.io/requester` annotation:

```bash
oc create clusterquota user-prod --project-annotation-selector openshift.io/requester=production --hard pods=12 --hard secrets=20 # create a cluster quota for all projects owned by the production user
oc create clusterquota env-qa --project-label-selector environment=qa --hard pods=10 --hard services=5 # create a cluster quota for all the projects with a label of environment=qa
oc delete clusterquota <quota>
```

ResourceQuota resource object that defines limits for CPU and memory:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: my-quota
spec:
  hard:
    limits.memory: "400Mi"                                            # by default quota attributes track resource request
    limits.cpu: "1200m"                                               # ...prefix the attribute with 'limits.' to track resource limits
```

```bash

**Managing Limit Ranges**

`LimitRange` resource, also called a limit, defines the default, minimum, and maximum values for compute resource requests and limits (also storage - default, min, max capacity requested by image, is, pvc) for a single pod or for a single container defined inside the project. A resource request or limit for a pod is the sum of its containers.

To understand the difference between a limit range and a resource quota resource, consider that a limit range defines valid ranges and default values for a single pod, while a resource quota defines only maximum values for the sum of all pods in a project.

The following listing shows a limit range defined using YAML syntax:

```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "LimitRange"
metadata:
  name: "limit-range"
spec:
  limits:
    - type: "Pod"
      max:
        cpu: "400m"                                                   # maximum CPU allowed across all containers in a pod
        memory: "256Mi"
      min:
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "64Mi"
    - type: "Container"
      max:
        cpu: "400m"                                                   # maximum CPU allowed per container
        memory: "256Mi"                                               # maximum memory allowed per container
      min:
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "64Mi"
      default:
        cpu: "200m"
        memory: "64Mi"
      defaultRequest:
        cpu: "200m"
        memory: "64Mi"
    - type: "PersistentVolumeClaim"
      min:
        storage: 2Gi
      max:
        storage: 50Gi                                                 # maximum capacity of the volume that can be requested by one claim
    - type: openshift.io/Image                                        # maximum size of an image that can be pushed to OCR
      max:
        storage: 1Gi
```

```bash
oc create -f limits.yml
oc get limits
  Name:       limit-range
  Namespace:  dev-project
  Type        Resource  Min   Max    Default Request  Default Limit
  ----        --------  ---   ---    ---------------  -------------
  Pod         cpu       100m  400m   -                -
  Pod         memory    64Mi  256Mi  -                -
  Container   cpu       100m  400m   200m             200m
  Container   memory    64Mi  256Mi  64Mi             64Mi
```

After creating a limit range in a project, all resource create requests are evaluated against each limit range resource in the project. If the new resource violates the minimum or maximum constraint enumerated by any limit, OpenShift rejects the resource. If the new resource does not set an explicit value, and the constraint supports a default value, then the default value is applied to the new resource as its usage value.

**OPENSHIFT SECURITY MODEL**

Infrastructure components, such as application nodes, use client certificates that OpenShift generates. Infrastructure components that run in containers use a token associated with their service account to connect to the API.

OpenShift Container Platform creates the PKI and generates the certificates at installation time. OpenShift uses an internal CA (`openshift-signer`) to generate and sign all the certificates that are listed in the master-config.yaml configuration file. This can be overriden in Ansible:

```text
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/to/certificate.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/private-key.key", "cafile": "/path/to/ca.crt"}]
```

To override names:

```text
openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates=true
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/to/certificate.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/private-key.key", "names": ["public-master-host.com"], "cafile": "/path/to/ca.crt"}]
```

On the master server, there are ~20 certificates and keys that are generated at installation time:

```bash
ls -l /etc/origin/master/*.{crt,key}
  additional_ca.crt                                                   # + .key
  ca-bundle.crt                                                       # + .key
  etcd.server.crt                                                     # + .key
  master.kubelet-client.crt                                           # + .key
  registry.crt                                                        # + .key

## 7. Providing Secure Network I/O

**ISTIO**

Sidecars sit alongside microservices and route requests to other proxies. These components form a mesh network.

- Definition of a `VirtualService`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - production.prod.svc.cluster.local
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: production-v2.prod.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v2
      weight: 25
    - destination:
        host: production-v1.prod.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v1
      weight: 75
```

- The `DestinationRule` associated with this virtual service:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: production-destination
spec:
  host: production.prod.svc.cluster.local
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
```

**MANAGING SECURE TRAFFIC IN OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM**

OpenShift can manage certificates by generating an X.509 certificate and a key pair as a secret in your application name spaces. Certificates are valid for the internal DNS name `service_name.namespace.svc`.

The following Red Hat Single Sign-on template shows how the service resource defines the annotation `service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` for generating the certificate with a value of `sso-x509-https-secret`.

The pod mounts the volume that contains this certificate in `/etc/x509/https`, as referenced by `secretName: sso-x509-https-secret` in the volumes section:

```yaml
kind: Template
apiVersion: v1
...output omitted...
objects:
- kind: Service                                                       # <--
  spec:
  metadata:
    annotations:
      service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: sso-x509-https-secret # <--
- kind: DeploymentConfig                                              # <--
...output omitted...
  spec:
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: "${APPLICATION_NAME}"
          image: "${APPLICATION_NAME}"
...output omitted...
          volumeMounts:
          - name: sso-x509-https-volume
            mountPath: "/etc/x509/https"
            readOnly: true
          volumes:
          - name: sso-x509-https-volume
            secret:
              secretName: sso-x509-https-secret                       # <--
```

Service serving certificates allow a pod to mount the secret and use them accordingly. The certificate and key are in PEM format, and stored as `tls.crt` and `tls.key`.

OpenShift automatically replaces the certificate when it gets close to expiration.

Pods can use these security certificates by reading the CA bundle located at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt`, which is automatically exposed inside pods.

If the service certificate generation fails, force certificate regeneration by removing the old secret, and clearing the following two annotations on the service:

```text
service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-<error_number>
service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num-<error_number>
```

The service serving certificates are generated on-demand, and thus are different from those used by OpenShift for node-to-node or node-to-master communication.

**Managing Network Policies in OpenShift**

3 SDNs:

1. `ovs-subnet` - flat network that spreads across all the cluster nodes and connects all the pods
2. `ovs-multitenant` - isolates each OpenShift project. By default, the pods in a project cannot access pods in other projects. The following command allows projectA to access pods and services in projectB, and vice versa: `oc adm pod-network join-projects --to=projectA projectB` - this give access to all pods & services in project.
`oc adm pod-network isolate-projects <project1> <project2>` - nothing can access between the projects
3. `ovs-networkpolicy` - To use network policies, you need to switch from the default SDN provider to the `redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy` provider. It allows you to create tailored policies between projects to make sure users can only access what they should (which conforms to the least privilege approach). By default, without any network policy resources defined, pods in a project can access any other pod.

To change, edit `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` and `/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml`:

```yaml
. . .
networkConfig:
  networkPluginName:
. . .
```

Example: Both networks are separate projects - The following network policy, which applies to all pods in network-A, allows traffic from the pods in network-B whose label is `role="back-end"`, but blocks all other pods:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: network-A_policy
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: back-end
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: network-B
```

Example: Both networks are separate projects - The following network policy, which applies to network-B, allows traffic from all the pods in network-A. This policy is less restrictive than the network-A policy, because it does not restrict traffic on any pods on the network-A project:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: network-B_policy
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: network-A
```

The following excerpt shows how to allow external users to access an application whose labels match `product-catalog` over a TCP connection on port 8080:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: external-access
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: product-catalog
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
```

```bash
ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0 -O OpenFlow13 --no-stats                     # flow rules on the Open vSwitch bridge on the node
```

The following network policy allows traffic coming from pods that match the `emails` label to access a database whose label is `db`:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: allow-3306
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db                                                         # destination
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: emails                                                 # source
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306
```

You can also define a default policy for your project. An empty pod selector means that this policy applies to all pods in this project. The following default policy blocks all traffic unless you define an explicit policy that overrides this default behavior:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: default-deny
spec:
  podSelector:
```

To manage network communication between two projects, assign a label to the project that needs access to another project:

```bash
oc label namespace front-end project=frontend_project                 # assigns the frontend_project label to the front-end project
```

The following network policy, which applies to a `back-end` project, allows any pods in the `front-end` project to access the pods labeled as `app=user-registration` through port 8080, in this `back-end` project:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: allow-8080-user-registration
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-registration
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:                                              # can be also 'podSelector:'
        matchLabels:
          project: frontend_project
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
```

**Node & Pod network**

OpenShift configures each cluster node with an Open vSwitch bridge named `br0`. For each pod, OpenShift creates a `veth` device and connects one end to the `eth0` interface inside the pod and the other end to the `br0` bridge:

```bash
nsenter -t 13120 --net ip link show                                   # run as root on the node, 13120 is PID of a process running inside the container. 'eth0@if36:' (connects eth0 inside container to the 36th interface on the node) is one of the links in the output.
ip link show | grep ^36:                                              # retrieve the other end of that veth device - e.g. 'vetha4f3b73f@if3:'
yum install -y openvswitch                                            # not installed by default, good for inspecting the network with ovs-vsctl
ovs-vsctl show | grep vetha4f3b73f                                    # shows the 'br0' and all the connected ports.
```

`tun0` interface on the node is an Open vSwitch port on the `br0` bridge, it is used for external cluster access

OpenShift uses the vxlan_sys_4789 interface on the node, or vxlan0 in br0, for building the cluster overlay network between nodes. Communications between pods on different nodes go through this interface.

**CONTROLLING EGRESS TRAFFIC**

By default, OpenShift allows egress traffic with no restrictions. You can control traffic with egress fw, routers, static IP. OpenShift allows traffic if no rule matches, checks rules in order.

1. Egress FWs
This object allows the egress traffic to the 192.168.12.0/24 network, and to the db-srv.example.com and analytics.example.com systems. The last rule denies everything else. The rules only apply to the egress traffic and do not affect inter-pod communication:

```yaml
kind: EgressNetworkPolicy
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myfirewall
spec:
  egress:
  - to:
      cidrSelector: 192.168.12.0/24
    type: Allow
  - to:
      dnsName: db-srv.example.com
    type: Allow
  - to:
      dnsName: analytics.example.com
    type: Allow
  - to:
      cidrSelector: 0.0.0.0/0
    type: Deny
```

```bash
oc create -f firewall.yaml -n myproject                               # only one per project, you must be cluster admin to create it
```

2. Egress Routers
  3 modes:
    1. Redirect   - image `openshift3/ose-pod` (TCP and UDP)
    2. HTTP proxy - image `openshift3/ose-egress-http-proxy` (HTTP and HTTPS)
    3. DNS proxy  - image `openshift3/ose-egress-dns-proxy` (TCP)

Can be used with any of the three SDN plugins, but underlying hosting platform may need to be reconfigured. Present a unique identifiable source IP address to the firewall and the external service.

Egress router is a particular pod running in your project with two interfaces (eth0, macvlan0). It acts as a proxy between your pods and the external service.

`macvlan0` interfaces are special devices that directly expose node interfaces to the container and has a MAC address seen by the underlying network.

```bash
nsenter -t 14171 --net ip addr show                                   # shows eth0@if22 and macvlan0@if2. IP address of the macvlan interface, 172.25.250.20 is not used by anything else and is the source IP address seen by the external firewall and service
ip link show | grep ^2:                                               # "2: eth0: ..."
```

In front of each egress router, you need to create an OpenShift service object. You use that service host name inside your application to access the external service through the router.

a/ Example - redirect mode (can only be created by cluster admin & application may need reconfiguration to access external service through egress router):

3. Enabling Static IP Addresses for External Access
You can define a static IP address at the project level, in the `NetNamespace` object. With such a configuration, all the egress traffic from the pods in the project originates from that IP address. OpenShift must use the `ovs-networkpolicy` SDN plug-in.

OpenShift automatically creates one `NetNamespace` object per project. First, associate IP with project and then node:

```bash
oc patch netnamespace myproject -p '{"egressIPs": ["172.25.250.19"]}' # associates the unused 172.25.250.19 address to the myproject project
oc get netnamespace myproject
  NAME        NETID     EGRESS IPS
  myproject   13508931  [172.25.250.19]
oc patch hostsubnet node1 -p '{"egressIPs": ["172.25.250.19"]}'       # associates the 172.25.250.19 address to node1 (you must indicate on which node OpenShift should assign the address)
oc get hostsubnet node1                                               # shows EGRESS IPS [172.25.250.19]
ssh root@node1 ip addr show dev eth0                                  # OpenShift declares the address as an alias on the external network interface of node1
```

When using the `oc patch` command to add a new address to a `HostSubnet` object that already has egress IP addresses defined for other projects, you must also specify those addresses in the `egressIPs` array:

```bash
oc patch hostsubnet node1 -p '{"egressIPs": ["172.25.250.19", "172.25.250.16", "172.25.250.15"]}' # otherwise new address replaces/overwrites all the existing ones
```

## 8. Providing Secure Storage I/O

**CATEGORIZING STORAGE TYPES IN OPENSHIFT**

1. Shared storage - GlusterFS, NFS, Ceph..
2. Block storage - EBS, GCE disk, iSCSI..

**Accessing Files in a Shared Storage Type in OpenShift**
If you need to access the same share from multiple pods, then you must configure each pod to use a default GID and define the group ownership of the share with a known GID:

```bash
chgrp test <directory>                                                # configure  dir with known GID
cat /etc/group | grep test                                            # test:x:1012:user
```

To enforce that your pod use a group, you must create a service account in each project. Each service account must be assigned to the same security constraint context (SCC) and it must restrict the limitations to a specific GID. Additionally, because the built-in SCC takes precedence over a custom one, you must set a higher priority in the custom SCC (`kind: SecurityContextConstraints`, `priority: XX`):

```bash
oc create serviceaccount <sccName> -n <projectName>                   # create the service account that configures the project with the custom SCC
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user <sccName> system:serviceaccount:<projectName>:<serviceAccount> # associate the service account with the SCC
```

**Accessing Files in a Block Storage Type in OpenShift**

Any OpenShift cluster can access block storage and even share the contents among pods in the same project. The first pod takes over ownership of the block storage, changing the GID and UID from that share. If any other pod running in the same project tries to access the same persistent volume bound to the block storage, the deployment fails due to lack of permissions.
To solve this problem, you must create a security constraint context that configures the `fsGroup` setting and allows any pod to access the same persistent volume.

## 9. Configuring Web Application Single Sign-on

1. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
2. OpenID Connect
3. JWT

Describing the OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow

1. The application redirects to the SSO server, which presents a login screen and validates the user's credentials.
2. On successful authentication, the SSO redirects back to the application providing a 'code'.
3. The application uses the code to request an access token from SSO server.
4. The SSO server returns an access token that the application uses to authorize end user's requests and to submit requests to other applications that are clients of the same SSO realm.

**CONFIGURING KEYCLOAK ADAPTERS FOR SINGLE SIGN-ON**

The core technology of Red Hat's SSO solution is the Keycloak open source project.

**DESCRIBING SSO CLIENT ACCESS TYPES**

1. 'client protocol' defines whether the application uses SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect
2. 'access type' defines whether the application is required to authenticate itself or not
3. 'valid Redirect URIs' protects the SSO server from sending tokens to applications other than the ones that initiated an authentication request
